# Deliberate Practice

Practicing with a clear awareness of the specific components of a skill we’re aiming to improve and exactly how to improve them

We need to know _what_ exactly has to change and what might get us there. Else, we plateau.

1. Break down to chunks and make them measurable
2. Choose the most important chunks first
3. Beware of vanity metrics
4. Have a mentor for chunks and a feedback loop
5. Track end goals in a longer interval
6. Maintain a motivation diary
7. Cultivate intense focus in the task we are doing
