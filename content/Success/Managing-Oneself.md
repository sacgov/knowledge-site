# Managing Oneself

Important points from Drucker's [Article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/managing-oneself)

History’s great achievers—a Napoléon, a da Vinci, a Mozart—have always managed themselves. That, in large measure, is what makes them great achievers. We will have to place ourselves where we can make the greatest contribution. First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results.

Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be filled. Third, discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it. Far too many people—especially people with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. First-rate engineers, for instance, tend to take pride in not knowing anything about people.

Like so many brilliant people, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. This planner will have to learn that the work does not stop when the plan is completed. He must find people to carry out the plan and explain it to them. He must adapt and change it as he puts it into action. And finally, he must decide when to stop pushing the plan.

Comparing your expectations with your results also indicates what not to do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre. In those areas a person—and especially a knowledge worker—should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence.

## How Do I Perform?

Amazingly few people know how they get things done. Indeed, most of us do not even know that different people work and perform differently. Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance

## How Do You Learn?

Most of them know the answer. But when I ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few answer Reading, writing, talking, doing.

## Am I a Leader or a Subordinate?

Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. Work to improve the way you perform.

## Do I Perform well under Stress ?

Or do I need a highly structured and predictable environment? Do i perform well in small orgs or large orgs What are my values?

## What Does the Situation Require?

Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference?

The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with so that you can make use of their strengths.

## What Does Promotion Mean?

A promotion isn't a reward for doing a really good job. A promotion is recognition that you can handle more scope.
