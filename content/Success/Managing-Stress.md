# Managing Stress

## Self-regulation and Stress

Managing stress should be approached from two different, complementary and interrelated angles:

1. First, stressors -- events or situations that result in the feeling of being overwhelmed or threatened -- should be identified and then assessed to ensure that individuals and groups are differentiating between less controllable sources of stress and those that are more controllable, either through changing the events or situations themselves or changing one’s response to them.
2. Second, for the less controllable sources of stress there are a broad range of constructive strategies for minimizing the toll they might otherwise take on our physical and emotional well-being.

List both the controllable and less controllable stressors in your life.

For the less controllable stressors, identify which of the following constructive strategies are you using to manage your stressors? You are also invited to include your own _**constructive strategies.**_

- Meditation, massage, visualisation and other techniques that evoke a “relaxation response”- shifting one’s “fight or flight” orientation to a more subdued and introspective one.
- Good nutrition. Pay attention to the foods you eat and how they make you feel emotionally and physically.
- Enjoying music, nature and the arts.
- Teaming up with one’s peers to help with stressful situations.
- Positive recognition of performance milestones and celebration of customs.
- Using humour to balance feelings of anxiety or to laugh at one’s self.

**Default strategies you that may not serve you and you should watch out for are:**

- Substance abuse, overeating, gambling, smoking, and other addictive behaviours.
- Procrastination, excessive time off, and other forms of avoiding responsibility.
- A victim mentality or, conversely, seeking excessive control of the environment.

## Practicing Self-management

The five key points to help you master Self-Management:

1. Be consistent. Part of managing oneself is the ability to be stable. The values you hold dear should always be transparent. Always changing can not only cause others to question your beliefs, but it can also cause you to become confused about what you truly believe.
2. Stick to the plan. If you are scheduled to complete a particular task, do it. Don’t just do it, but make sure it is done in a timely manner. It is easy to feel out of control when you disregard the plan you are to follow.
3. Be accountable. There are times when things don’t work out as you plan, but you have to be able to admit that and then use your flexibility to get things back on track. The ideal result is that you easily bounce back and complete the task, but even during those times when this is not the case, you are expected to adjust.
4. Educate yourself. We live in an ever-changing world and you want to be able to keep up with it. Don’t let change pass you by, embrace it. Be an avid reader. Talk and listen to mentors and peers. They may know something that could help you along your journey.
5. Stay physically fit. Many people don’t think of staying fit when they talk about self-management, but it is a very important part of being able to practice the four preceding points. Exercising your body is just as crucial to self-management as exercising your mind. A body that is not well rested, nutritionally fed, or physically exercised can lead to emotional and physical illnesses.
