# Willpower Instinct

> We can never our thoughts. But you can always choose how to act upon them.

Willpower is of three types

1. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt‚Äù¬†power
2. ‚ÄúI will‚Äù¬†power
3. ‚ÄúI want‚Äù power

`I wont` allows to not go for unhealthy habits.

`I will` allows to delay gratification and follow discomfort.

`I want` allows to be inline with our long term goals.

Responses are of 2 types

1. Stop-and-pause
2. Fight-or-flight

Stop-and-pause causes us to check on willpower reservers and long term thinking kicks in

üí°¬†Willpower is a like a muscle. Gets depleted by the night. And needs recuperation

It can also be worked on by exercising it more often causing less and less will power to resist in future situations

Eating healthy food, exercise, sleep can replenish willpower

**Giving yourself a reward that drives you away from your long-term goal is counter-productive**

Delaying gratification

There is an instant gratification monkey in each of our brains. This is known as the reptile brain.

There is another part this is responsible for will power and taking decisions

Sometimes our will power muscle is weak especially after dealing with kids, a long day at work and a long week. `Fri-Yay` Haha

Monkey brain takes over when the space and time is suitable to it.

Seeing the chips or chocolate at the counter after a long day causes us to impulse buy it.

Taming the will-power monkey

**Visual affirmation**. Think of like i am already eating this chocolate and ignore the actual chocolate. Or think of the healthy abs showing and people seeing me in awe, giving more dopamine than the chocolate can give

**Delaying :** Ignoring the chocolate takes will power, instead say that i will get it tomorrow for sure. Or for smokers say to oneself that we will do in the next 10 minutes. Normally something would come up in those 10 mins. We should strive to go out of that `space and time` and we now are more equipped to tame the monkey brain

**Taking deep breaths :** Taking deep breaths slows down time as perceived by the brain and it provides the bandwidth needed for the willpower to kick in and kick out the monkey brain instincts

Some people are genetically better at managing will power but anyone can get better at it with a few practices like the above and go towards a healthier and fulfilling life.
