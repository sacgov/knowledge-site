# Kinder-version-of-success

Excerpt from the [Talk](Success/Kinder-Version-of-Success.md)

## The Gap

The gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge painfully. The gap seems to increasing everyday.

It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living. It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.

## What Causes the Gap

### Societal Expectation

Most people make a strict correlation between how much time, love, society would accord us, would be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy.

Hence we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring about material goods. I don't think we are particularly materialistic. I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods. It's not the material goods we want; It's the rewards we want. It's a new way of looking at luxury goods. To a person driving a Ferrari, don't think, "This is someone greedy.","This is someone who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love." Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.

### Achievement and Expectation

Expectations have never been so high on human beings on things one can achieve with their lifespan. We're told _anyone can achieve anything_ . We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please. And it's a beautiful idea. Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality; we're all basically equal. There are no strictly defined hierarchies.

There is one really big problem with this, and that problem is envy. If there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy. And it's linked to the spirit of equality. We are not envious the Queen of England. She's simply too strange. We can't relate to her, When you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them.

## Problems

### Envy

Envy is a result of expectation.
The problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a village.
Everybody's wearing jeans, everybody's the same. And yet, they're not.

There's a spirit of equality alongside deep inequality, which can make very stressful situation. It's as unlikely to be as rich and famous as Bill Gates, as it was unlikely in 17 th century to reach the ranks of the French aristocracy. But now it doesn't feel that way. It's made to feel, by media that you, too, could start a major thing.

### The Kind of Books Today

The first kind tells you, "You can do it! You can make it! Anything's possible!" Second deals with what we politely call "low self-esteem," or impolitely call, "feeling very bad about yourself."

There's a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything, and low self-esteem.

## Meritocracy

It is difficult to be self compassionate as we need to own our mistakes

If you've got talent and energy and skill, you will get to the top, nothing should hold you back. It's a beautiful idea. The problem is, your position in life comes to seem not accidental, but merited and deserved. That makes failure seem much more crushing. In the Middle Ages, in England, when you met a very poor person, that person was an "unfortunate" -- literally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate. Now someone at the bottom of society, are unkindly be described as a "loser." There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser, and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives. It's no longer the gods, it's us. We're in the driving seat. That's exhilarating if you're doing well, and very crushing if you're not.

This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to, I think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.

We think very highly of ourselves, and so we should; we've put people on the Moon, done all sorts of extraordinary things. And so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes. That's a very new situation. Most other societies have had, right at their center, the worship of something transcendent: a god, a spirit, a natural force, the universe, whatever it is something else that is being worshiped.

## Our Notions of Success

If I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful, certain ideas would immediately come to mind. You'd think that person might have made a lot of money, achieved renown in some field. We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't.

Any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is. I think any wise life will accept, as I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding. Also a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. We also suck in messages from everything from the television, to advertising, to marketing, etc. These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves.

When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession, a lot want to go into banking. When banking is no longer so respectable, we lose interest in banking. We are highly open to suggestion.

## Being Clear in Our Notions of Success

Not give up on our ideas of success, but make sure they are our own. Focus in on our ideas, and make sure that we own them; that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want, and find out, at the end of the journey, that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along.

## Conclusion

Let's probe away at our notions of success. Make sure our ideas of success are truly our own. But we should always remember that whoever is facing us, whatever has happened in their lives, there will be a strong element of the haphazard and luck. That's what I'm trying to leave room for; otherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic.
