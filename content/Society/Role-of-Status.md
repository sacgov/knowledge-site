# Role of Status

This is still a draft. I need to fill in details into this one.

We listen to people with power.
Charisma matters. They increase the chances of one becoming a politician.

## Socio Economic Position

People defer to position and signals of status

People with higher status find it easier to succeed further fuelling their status.

A few studies in this [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9043205/) People honk at a cheap cat but not a costly one.
People jay walk if a person in coat jaywalks
Models get more donations. People clothed well get better help.
This makes intuitive sense as people can be safe around rich people technically. They potentially would not harm us. In the traditional animal pecking order, higher status animals have no reason to show their superiority on lower status ones. They instead would fight with ones above them to rise higher in the order. From [Chimpanzee Politics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/389530.Chimpanzee_Politics)

**Potential in the future** matters more than the current skills.

## Appearance

Looking powerful is more important than actually being powerful. Smaller animals assume postures and colours that fend off powerful animals

Dominant people tend to get promoted, elected, paid more and let into first in the lift. This does not translate to happier though. Just noting.

Heroes tend to be taller and villians shorter, especially the smarter villain.
Witches tend to be hideous, Mother-in-laws fat and the Heroines slim. These characteristics nudge us to associate certain traits.
Fat implies mean in the movies. This is definitely not true. Probably in the olden days, when food was scarce, a fat animal meant it was hoarding food or taking it away from others.

## Attractiveness

Attractiveness is a part of appearance. But it is the most important part of appearance apart from dominance, and being richly groomed.

Attractiveness leads to 10-15 % increase in value.

Conventionally Non - attractive women have it ever worse than men. Because it is even more difficult for women to project dominance and other traits in [Appearance](Society/Role-of-Status.md#Appearance).

Dressing professionally to signal dominance helps conventionally non-attractive people.
