# Give and Take

Notes from Adam Grant's [Give And Take](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158498-give-and-take) and the [post](https://nesslabs.com/taker-giver-matcher).

## Types of People

- **Takers.** Takers are self-focused and only help others strategically, when the benefits to themselves outweigh the personal costs. They like to get more than they give. They tilt reciprocity in their own favour, putting their own interests ahead of others’ needs.
- **Givers.** Givers will help whenever the benefits to others exceed the personal costs. In the workplace, givers are a relatively rare breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get.
- **Matchers.** Strike a fine balance between giving and taking. Matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity. If you’re a matcher, you believe in tit for tat, and your relationships are governed by even exchanges of favours.

## How Do the People Fare?

## How to Be a Smart Giver?

If your goal is moderate success, you can decide to act like a taker or a matcher. But if you want to make it to the top, you need to be a giver.

- **Change your mindset.** How can you align your decisions so when you win, everyone wins? Instead of being self-focused like a taker or transactional like a matcher, think of an expanding pie where everyone can benefit from your success.
- **Help wisely.** Focus on how the giving is done. Tracking your impact does not mean you need to become a taker and only help when it benefits you, nor that you need to become a matcher and only help when you receive equal value in return. Rather, it means that you need to make sure you are helping achieve goals that are beneficial in general, not only to the person you are helping. Ask yourself: is this good for the company, for the customers, for the team? In a personal context, ask: is this good for our group of friends, our family, or our relationship in general? If the answer is no, try to brainstorm a better solution.
- **Track your impact.** Check the outcome of the last giving. In the end, who benefitted from your help? Was it just one person, who may have been a taker? Or did your help have a wider positive impact, which justifies the time and energy you spent to provide your support?

## What Does Giving Mean to Me?

Giving does not mean donating money. It does mean being infinitely available burning myself out. It also does not mean, i do not refuse to help.
Giving entails not looking for reciprocation while offering to help. Doing a giving for the greater good.

Since we have limited resources, we can choose to the areas we want to give.
Maybe at an org, i want to mentor new hires. I would give only in the area of 'Mentoring'. This ensures i am not walked over or i receive random requests for help.

## Givers Should Ask

Giving does not mean being less assertive and timid. We should ask for what is rightfully ours or if it is affecting us.
