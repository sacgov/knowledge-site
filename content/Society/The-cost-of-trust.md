# Cost of Trust

Trust is the costliest thing. And that's why everything is costliest in India.

Can’t trust public schools, let’s invest in private schools and tuitions.

Can’t trust public hospitals, let’s spend in expensive private hospitals.

Can’t trust water in home tap, let’s install water filter at home.

Can’t trust public transport, let’s invest in our own two wheelers.

Can’t trust banks or regime, let’s invest in Gold.

Can’t trust telcos, let’s use prepaid.

Can’t trust security of city, let’s install steel grills on all windows.

Can’t trust the buyer, let’s get demand draft.

Can’t trust the tenant, let’s collect huge deposit.

Can’t trust regular water supply, let’s install water tanks.

Can’t trust stability of electricity, let’s install UPS.

Can’t trust behaviour of men, let’s have separate compartment for ladies.

Hidden costs we pay due to lack of trust and institutions is something we don’t realize or don’t know as most have not experienced anything better.
