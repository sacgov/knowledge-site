# Macronutrients

Scientists focus on nutrients as it can be measured and not food. But ultimately people eat food and not nutrients.

## Dietary Carbohydrates

Simple are monosachharides - glucose fructose, disaccharides - sucrose table sugar
Complex sugars - starch - indigestible ones like fiber.

We generate ATP from carbs. It is stored as adipose tissue.

Proteins are used to build amino acids that can be used build and repair lean tissue, It can also be converted to ATP and adipose if needed.

Fats are broken down to energy or adipose tissue. They are the most dense energy 9 cal per gram. Carbs and protein give 4 cal /gm .

Reducing the consumption of calories the sure and best way to reduce fat in the body

Low carb diets suggest carbs are bad. That is wrong partly. We need fiber.

### Glycemic Index

How fast glucose is released into the blood. Soda/ white bread releases fast. Brown rice/ grains releases slowly. This leads to higher insulin being secreted in to the body.

Lowering the glycemic index is important. Learning to choose the best food among each category is important for long term success.

## Animal Proteins

Essential for cellular structure, lean tissue, immune functions & cell signalling.

There are 20 types of animo acids.
We cannot generate 9 of them and mark them as essentials

Eggs and fish are complete sources of protein

Tofu, beans, lentils, nuts - these tend to be incomplete sources of protein. Health benefits of such diet out weights the risk of losing a few compared to complete food like eggs. As a vegetarian, i struggle with this.

Moderating red meat is great since it reduces LDL cholesterol. Tends to have sodium, and nitrates which is not that great for health.

## Fats

It's a major source of energy. It helps you absorb some vitamins and minerals. Fat is needed to build cell membranes, the vital exterior of each cell, and the sheaths surrounding nerves. It is essential for blood clotting, muscle movement, and inflammation. For long-term health, some fats are better than others. Good fats include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Bad ones include industrial-made trans fats. Saturated fats fall somewhere in the middle.
Good fats and bad fats are an important distinction to make.

**Saturated fats**. Saturated means they are saturated with hydrogen and flat and are packed more efficiently. They are solids at room temperature - butter

**Unsaturated fats** - have carbon double bonds . Hence are liquids at room temperature. Oils

**Omega-3 fatty acids**, nuts ,flax seeds, fish oil. Body cannot make omega-3 and hence essential to consume it from outside.

The unsaturated turn into to trans fats from cis fats on boiling them like in fast food centres. Saturated fats also increase LDL but they at least do not reduce HDL.

## What is a Good Diet

Whole foods is the best way to maintain weight. Diets do not matter. But certain diets are easier to follow than others.

The Mediterranean diet has lots of olive oil and little meat, did more physical labor. They fasted regularly. They ate a lot of wild greens — weeds. They consumed far fewer total calories than we do. Vegetarians tend to be non alcoholics. These extraneous but unavoidable factors are called, aptly, ”confounders.” People who take supplements are healthier as better-educated, more-affluent people who, almost by definition, take a greater-than-normal interest in personal health — confounding factors that probably account for their superior health.
