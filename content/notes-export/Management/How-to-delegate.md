# How to Delegate?

![Delegation](assets/Delegation.png)

## **Before Delegation**

### Know what You want

Don't start delegation in brain storming mode. Have everything written on a piece of paper/ Jira Ticket and then assign the task.

### Start with Small Tasks

Create a status report - > simple task → delegate
Deliver a training Report company wide → difficult and high stakes → don't delegate

### Delegating Sensitive Tasks - Don't

The ones your manager assigned you to do.
Performance issues, hiring, firing.
Activities that require confidential information.

### Who to Delegate

Detail oriented do finance tasks better and big picture guys do creative things better
If we don't get role-fit. Look for natural leader who want to take on more management responsibilities

## During Delegation

### Setup a Small Meeting

Schedule a quick meeting and go over the task. They absorb the info slowly
_Do Not_ just send a text message or email.

### Be Direct and Go Slow

Be 100 % clear and go very slowly over the tasks. People take time to process information and do not want to feel dumb by asking me to repeat myself.

### Verify Understanding

Confirm that they fully _understand_ the task.
Continuously ask questions like does this make sense. Shall i repeat it?
Allow them to clarify misunderstandings upfront

### Avoid Being Prescriptive

Focus on the objectives and not the process. What and not the how.
Team members to own the task

### Confirm Commitment to Results

Highlight the results and make sure your subordinate is committed and accountable to them.
Your success means *end* goal and this is *benefit* to you.
Does the end with this benefit to the company/employee seem reasonable ? Do you have any concerns ?

### Explain that Delegation is a Work in Progress

Explain that for both of us this is a learning phase.
List things that are going well
List things that are not going well

### Be Specific on Timelines

No timeline means no work.
Be very specific on the first verify, soft deadline, hard deadline.

### Explain Authority Levels

In some tasks authority is sometimes ambiguous.
You are allowed to take decision in X, Y matters but an approval for Z matters.

### Define a Guidance Process

Err on the side of the caution. Ask them to submit a proposal on how they would do the task.
Think though potential options
Come up with a recommendation and a reasoning

## After Delegation

## Do not Disappear

Please checkin at the early stages
Use your scheduled checkpoints and be fully attentive during those calls
Avoid slipping into Seagull Management and only showing up when things do not go well.

## Avoid Micro Management

Lack of skillset - Have them coached
Don't manage aggressively

### Feedback

Positive feedback.
What went well. What can be improved
Allow for Mistakes
How do you think we can solve this
How do we avoid these things going forward
Document the Feedback

People leave their monkeys with me. Reverse Delegation.
