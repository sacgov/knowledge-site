# Fast Vs Slow

I know there are several advantages in terms of speed and blocker resolution of fast-paced sprints and regular sync-ups.

The above question needs much thought. But I have a different counterintuitive opinion. Speed and quality are the same things. Quality breeds speed and speed breeds quality. I think it is wrong to assume a slower pace gives quality software.

For an analogy, the Usain bolt runs faster because he has fewer injuries. He has fewer injuries not because he runs slower but because he runs with quality ( We think reducing speed reduces injuries which is correct but he runs fast). How did he get fast?

Learning to correct improper techniques quickly. Running fast in the first place to know what is improper. The real problem starts when we do not know how to improve our technique but try to run fast. Slowing down would mean being out of competition. We should slow down, not to reduce the pace but to think about what we could improve. In a large org like ours different people can do this. Eg - Bolt runs and the coach thinks.

We have many blockers because our code quality might be lower. It is not that slower code development would have raised fewer blockers. The extra time from slower development practices would have made up for the time saved by blockers.

The pace of software delivery comes not from reducing the speed or from increasing the quality. But its resilience to change is ever relevant to software. There is no way to define quality. Does quality mean fewer blockers? If no one uses it, Surely there would be no blockers.

We cannot think of all the possibilities while designing the first iteration. But we can make it easier to build a second iteration faster. This does not need more time just experience, practice, open communication of problems and asking for guidance from senior, managers, and other leads.

- What flexibility are we losing while building the current feature
- What is something we have neglected over the last 10-15 features in a project
- Do we know the metrics to diagnose the problems?
- Are we regularly watching our metrics?
- Are we running in pain or should we apply the first aid
- Are we working on our ability to recover/pivot faster which would mean shipping the next features easier? I think this wins in the long run.

I think we should always run fast and fail fast.

The key is maintaining the ability to recover fast. Running slow does not ensure quality and we would inefficient as a company so the newly expanded time would seem lesser soon.
