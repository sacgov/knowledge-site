# Just because

Just because your past was painful doesn’t mean your future won’t be miraculous.
Just because you didn’t do something yesterday doesn’t mean you can’t achieve it today.
Just because you couldn’t see a solution to a problem a little while ago doesn’t mean a solution isn’t on the way right now.
Just because someone breaks a promise made to you doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep the promises you make to others.
Just because someone took more than they gave doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be a majestic giver. And mightily generous.
Just because a person is always late doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be on time.
Just because daily reading isn’t so popular in a world of cyber-zombies doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be a lifelong book lover. And the most knowledgeable person in your field.
Just because someone you trusted betrayed your belief in them doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be trustworthy.
Just because a dream you pursued led to fierce disappointment doesn’t mean you shouldn’t remain a delighted dreamer.
Just because someone you love behaves un lovingly doesn’t mean they don’t deserve your love. (Beneath anger always lies grief and underneath attack always exists sadness.)
Just because impeccable politeness and meticulous manners are in short supply doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be of a unique breed—and be the most considerate, sophisticated and dignified person in your community.
Just because going the extra mile isn’t so common anymore doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t represent uncommon delivery. And exquisite ability. Your integrity demands that you refuse to participate in and send out any form of mediocrity, right?
Just because you made a mistake doesn’t mean the respect people give to you is mistaken.
Just because some human beings are all about themselves doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stand for helpfulness, service and kindness, with few limits.
Just because you have wounds to heal and limits to dissolve doesn’t mean you’re broken.
