# Decision Making

There are only two things that determine your life: luck and the quality of your decisions. And you only have control over your decisions.

A good tool has a use that can be repeated. Use the tool the same way, get the same results.

## Process Vs Result

We tend to look at outcomes of decisions to determine whether a decision was good or bad, rather than looking at the process. This is called "resulting."
In reality, luck plays a role in every decision.

## Hindsight

"Hindsight bias" occurs when we try to remember what we knew and how we felt when we made a decision. It is almost impossible to accurately reconstruct these things after the fact, when we know the outcome.

Markers of this thinking are things like "I should have known" or "I knew it all along."

Keeping a decision journal, or writing down what you know when you make the decision, is one way to counter this. You can read it later and remember more accurately.

### The Three Ps: Preferences, Payoffs and Probabilities

Possible options for your decision.
Possible outcomes within each option.
Preference for each path

Estimate the likelihood of each option

Don't forget that the payoffs of each option and outcome can be things other than money: happiness, time, self-esteem, etc.
The downside of pros and cons lists are that they don't take into account the magnitude of the upside or downside, which is critical.

Always collect more information before you decide.

## Breaking Free from Analysis Paralysis

The key to making faster decisions is understanding what the cost is for making a worse decision. If the cost is low, you should go fast. If the cost is high, you should go slow.

One way to help assess this is to project yourself in the future: will you care about the outcome of this decision tomorrow? In a week? In a year?

You can also move faster by asking yourself: if this was the only option I had, would I be happy? If yes, make the decision and move on.

Another good question to ask: If I pick this option, what's the cost of quitting?

## Buffett Method for Decision Making

**Causes**: What is happening here in simple words and why? Where and why does it work but not elsewhere - Conditions ?
**Implications**: What is the consequence of this observation, event, or experience? What does that imply?
**Purpose**: Why should we do that? Why do I want this to happen?
**Reason**: Why is this better than other courses?
**Usefulness**: What is the applicability of this to the path of success?
**End**: Begin with the end in mind
**More Information**: Will more information affect my decision? Don't collect data randomly.
**Understanding**: Big idea that helps explain and predict?

# Reframing the Decision

When facing a difficult decision, try to reframe it in a way that will reduce, or at least switch around, the biases that might be influencing it.
Example - Should i move to Bengaluru, away from my hometown of Hyderabad in India. I am moving because of a better pay. If i already had that pay in Bengaluru, would i have moved back to Hyderabad taking a pay cut. This is a much easier question.
