# Psychology of Money

Notes from the [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money) by Morgan Housel

No ones crazy. every ones acts according to their internalised experiences. Inflation, recessions or continuous rally of stocks in teens define the strategies even 30 years later.

Health and money impact every one

Nothing is as good or bad as it seems. Kent evans died on a mountaineering accident. Not even a car accident at astronomical odds.

The exact role of luck in successful outcomes is everything.

rockefller was not a law abiding citizen and it made him wealthy but we cannot follow on his footsteps

We need to know what is `enough` for us. `enough` does not mean too little.

social comparison is always a problem.

there are many things never worth taking no matter the potential gain

Good investment is not about decisions but consistency

we can be wrong half the time and still win like the VC industry

controlling your time is the dividend that money pays

no one is impressed by our possessions or achievements as much as we are

Value of wealth/ achievements is relative to what you need

There is never a reason not to save or work hard

control of time is an unseen result of wealth

reasonable > rational

the lesson from surprises is that we cannot be prepared for them. The world will always surprise us. We cannot individually prepare for a particular surprise. We need to be prepared for _any_ surprise.

long term planning is harder than it seems as peopleâ€™s goals and desires keep changing

we make decisions that change us and when we change the results are actually received by a newer version of ourselves.

we should come to accept the reality of our changing minds

Everything has a price and it is not always labelled. some times we pay the price now or push it ahead to pay later.

Beware taking advice from people in a different game

Optimism does not appear rational while Pessimism does as it is an evolutionary instinct.

Stories are powerful than statistics.

Everyone has an incomplete narrative of the world. we fill with gaps. We form our own reality.
