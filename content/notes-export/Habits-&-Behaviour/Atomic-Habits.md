# Atomic Habits

## One line Summary

For self-improvement without self-discipline, update your self-image.

## Lineage of Habits

The behaviours that you're taking are shaped or influenced by the habits that preceded them. Having a few minutes free in your kitchen and you habitually pull your phone out of your pocket. Then we proceed to playing games or scroll Instagram.

## Seeing Results

What gives results Results are a mix of luck and habits. Sometimes habit forming is also easier with certain genes. But we cannot control genes and luck. All we can do is alter habits. Results a measure of habits preceding them.

## Delayed Gratification

Humans typically lived in an environment that had immediate reward. Like eating the fruit or sex. Modern society has created structures favouring delayed rewards. This is in large because most of the immediate rewards are pretty much guaranteed today.

Out Palaeolithic hardware is not exactly adapted to modern society. Hence the need to change the behaviours.

## Habit Categories

Habits can be adaptive or maladaptive. Typically the habits we call good in a general sense are the ones that have delayed rewards and quick gratification ones like smoking are bad. If the feedback is painful we change faster. We also form new habits faster if it is pleasurable.

## Free Will and Habits

If there is free will, then it is better to change for the better If there is no free will, it is not in our control anyways. I agree with James' position that it is not worth debating free will. It is of no practical importance to people's lives.

In the sports gene, David Epstein finds some research that suggests that what we think of as genetic characteristics like speed and agility were training based, and grit and discipline had a higher genetic element. The desire to train harder is genetic too. That doesn't mean we should not aspire to be better. Genes do not tell us to not work hard but instead align to our natural propensity It is hard to beat a person who is having fun. Not all of us have the good fortune of stumbling upon it at age 6. But we can always try different things Eventually we would land onto something we can let consume our lives.

## Drive to Succeed

All the successful people have a drive like no other. There is no point in competing with or even comparing with them. We do not know if it is a better life. We should go after what we want. That means comparing ourselves with where were yesterday. We should get financially independent and not get a dopamine rush of comparison with bill gates. Our minds would soon strike that down as impossible and we would stop persisting on our habits. True mavericks like Bill Fates do believe that in fact they can be richest or the fastest like Aryton Senna.

## Sustaining Good Habits

One of the most motivations feelings is a sense of progress in the direction of our goals. If something cannot go on for ever, it will not.

It is hard to sustain goal based habits. This requires motivation. If i cannot be happy till I lose 10 pounds. Maybe i will stick till 10 pounds. But only this cannot lead to long lasting changes I need to love playing the instrument. I need to love eating healthy food. Winners and losers both have the same goals. Goals are important to set the direction. Goals are necessary but not sufficient. We need to build a machinery in our life that leads to results.

## Mental Shift

Becoming a runner is different than running a marathon once. Building a system helps us win again and again You don't rise to the level of your expectations you fall to level of your training

Habits should be atomic

1. Part of a larger system
2. Small enough to implement
3. Should be a source of energy and joy

## Why Habits Matter - Building Identity

Habits fetch us results. But their main function is building an identity. How we perceive ourselves. They are a signal internally to ourselves about who we are and what we care about When someone offers a drink, Some one who says i am trying to quit is trying harder than someone who says that he is a teetotaler. Be the person that is healthy eater not someone who is trying hard to diet. Craving a hamburger and not eating is much harder than not wanting it in the first place.

### Changing Cold Turkey Happens time to time

But it is not possible to rely on this. This requires a fundamental change in environment like having a kid, marriage or moving cities or a change in world view like reading a book that demonizss carbs.

### Cast Votes towards the Person You want to Become

The brain wants proof of our ambition. So taking the stairs actually improves our odds of eating healthy food later tonight. This is because it cast a vote towards an healthy identity. It is tough to fake it till we make it. It is easy to cast simple votes reinforcing our making it everyday. Once the identity is entrenched we feel bad when we digress from a habit as it is breaking our identity. The cotton candy and alcohol now feels horrible. It would bother us if we do not workout on a day.

### Making Irreversible Changes Work Better

Buying an amazon device that turns off the internet did not work as it can be reversed. This is why chrome website blockers do not work. What worked for james to wake up early is getting a dog that needs a walk at 7 am. People smoke through pregnancy but not after a child is born. Here the visual feedback cue is glaring in the eyes.

### Taking Pride in the Identity

People who do not groom themselves well do not identify themselves as beautiful or beauty as important which makes grooming a chore. People who identify as a well groomed person perceive grooming as essential.

### Environment Matters

We all feel the need to belong to a tribe. It can be a large one like Indian but small ones like belonging to the neighbourhood. If a neighbourhood is wealthy we tend to get wealthy too. Same goes for healthy. It is best to join groups where your behaviour is the default behaviour. The desire to belong is greater than any other desire to improve as it is primordial survival instinct.

## Habit Laws

The famous model cue->action->reward. Seeing a loaf of bread does not trigger the habit at 4 pm as opposed to 7 pm to create a toast out of it. Emotions are predictive. They are not as reactive as we see them to be. James when sad would not drink but eat junk food. He associates drinks to good times. Few people would not eat anything let alone junk food when they are sad.

1. Make it obvious. You want the cues of your good habits to be available, visible and easy to get your attention. More likely you are to act on it
2. Make it attractive. This is about anticipating a reward
3. Make it frictionless.
4. Make it satisfying.

Breaking a bad habit involves inverting these laws. Lose the cues. Evict from the environment causing it. Associate disgust with habit. Visualise the pain on following through the bad habits.

Now if we are not able to remove the cues. We can replace the actions with a different actions. Diet coke instead of coke. Both are harmful though. Walk instead of eating junk food to relieve stress.

## How to Make Forming Habits Easier

### Do not Fight the Environment

Fighting against the environment is an uphill battle
We all have things that are important to us. But in an environment we will go for what is available to us in the path of least resistance.

### Dividing the Day - Sleeping well

An interesting thought process is dividing the day into 4 quarters and plan 5 mins for these quarters and not fail in at least 2 quarters/day. Especially the sleeping well part of the night quarter

### Mistakes Compound

Rapid course correction is necessary after a mistake. Rapid but not frequent as that leads to indecision. Let go of the need to be perfect. The world is complex and the situations dynamic. It's not possible for someone to predict the optimal course of action and even if you could it is very unlikely that it will remain the optimal course of action so given that things are going to be changing. You're going to be off course at some point

### Stochastic Progression

[Stochastic-Learning](Success/Stochastic-Learning.md)
Keep course correcting but not deciding everyday as you ideally want it to be a habit.

## How to Change

Note down the habits we do all day. This can be waking up, brushing, noting something down etc. Exercising in the evening. The goal is understanding the context in which these events are happening, the cues and the environment. We tend to become conscious of a behaviour that is being evaluated. So this leads us to improve.

Just tracking the calories not counting leads to improving of nutrition habits. Visualising the progress improves our stickiness to the goals as well

Meeting a friend for a run at 6 AM is easier than going alone for a run as the former is more attractive. Accountability partners make life better. Remind the costs of not following through. Never punish the behaviour we want to see in others like making fun We do not need a lot of motivation. Just enough on an afternoon to set an environment or take an action. Registering for a piano class ensure we practice piano at least a bit Master the art of showing up. That is all it takes. It is quite difficult to get this right though. A habit must be established before it can be improved. Do not aim for all the improvement on first day There is not use for a perfect plan if it is not actionable. Non Habits are not actionable for long.
**The heaviest weight in the gym is the door.**

People who exercise are mostly the most unlikely of people to actually need exercising as much. The people who read books to optimise their habits pretty likely have good habits. To get a person who does not read well or does not eat well to change their habits is pretty tough.
