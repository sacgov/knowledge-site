# Bertrand Russell on Happiness on Happiness

[Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell)

This note has similar content as other notes on happiness. This note is a compilation of Russell's thoughts on happiness.

I had the habit of meditating on my sins, follies, and shortcomings. I seemed to myself — no doubt justly — a miserable specimen. Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to centre my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.

## Why

Megalomaniac wants to be feared and the narcissist loved.

Vanity, when it passes beyond a point, kills pleasure in every activity for its own sake, and leads inevitably to listlessness and boredom. Its cure lies in the growth of self-respect. It is gained by successful activity inspired by objective interests.

An unhappy person has an image of himself as he thinks he ought to be, which is in continual conflict with his knowledge of himself as he is.

Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact.

Men seek distraction which is cessation of unhappiness rather than happiness.

## Competition Comparison

The man who acquires easily things for which he feels only a very moderate desire concludes that the attainment of desire does not bring happiness. A person who has everything is normally unhappy.

To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.

What people fear when they engage in the struggle is not that they will fail to get their breakfast next morning, but that they will fail to outshine their neighbours.

The businessman's religion and glory demand that he should make much money; therefore, like the Hindu widow, he suffers the torment gladly.

The feeling of success makes it easier to enjoy life. Money, up to a certain point, is very capable of increasing happiness. What I do maintain is that success can only be one ingredient in happiness, and is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it.

There are two motives for reading a book: one, that you enjoy it; the other, that you can boast about it.

Young men and young women meet each other with much less difficulty than was formerly the case, and every housemaid expects at least once a week as much excitement as would have lasted a Jane Austen heroine throughout a whole novel.

## Anxiety & Thoughts

It is amazing how much both happiness and efficiency can be increased by the cultivation of an orderly mind, which thinks about a matter adequately at the right time rather than inadequately at all times.

Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile.

A great many worries can be diminished by realizing the unimportance of the matter which is causing the anxiety.

All forms of fear produce fatigue.

## Envy

Beggars do not envy millionaires but other beggars who are more successful.

No use envying someone, I imagine perhaps quite falsely, as fortunate than myself.

## Surroundings

Be in a surrounding that is congenial.

Intelligent young people in Western countries tend to have that kind of unhappiness that comes of finding no adequate employment for their best talents

Let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.

Life is too short to be interested in everything, but it is good to be interested in as many things as are necessary to fill our days.

## Affection

Many people, when they fall in love look for a little haven of refuge from the world, where they can be sure of being admired when they are not admirable, and praised when they are not praiseworthy. To many men home is a refuge from the truth: it is their fears and their timidities that make them enjoy a companionship in which these feelings are put to rest. They seek from their wives what they obtained formerly from an unwise mother, and yet they are surprised if their wives regard them as grown-up children.

On the whole women tend to love men for their character while men tend to love women for their appearance.

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.

Happiness of parenthood greater than any other that Russell experienced

## Work

To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level.

Without self-respect genuine happiness is scarcely possible. And the man who is ashamed of his work can hardly achieve self-respect.

The world is full of things that are tragic or comic, heroic or bizarre or surprising, and those who fail to be interested in the spectacle that it offers are forgoing one of the privileges that life has to offer.

## Effort & Resignation

The happy man is the man who lives objectively, who has free affections and wide interests, who secures his happiness through these interests and affections and through the fact that they, in turn, make him an object of interest and affection to many others
