# Essentialism

Learnings from [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18077875)

## Choosing less

**Less is better than more.**
**Many priorities mean not having a priority at all.**

We need to assess trade-offs and choose only minimal things
If we do not prioritise our life someone else will.
Remove items that are good but not the best as only then would we have space for the best

Perfect is attained not when everything is attained but nothing left to remove

## Choosing Mindfully

**Do anything but not everything.**

The ability to choose cannot be given or taken away. It can only be forgotten.
Practically everything is unimportant
Apply [Pareto Principle](Bytes/Definition-Repository.md#Pareto%20Principle%20) at all times

We cannot attain a life without problems. But we can choose the problems we want to get into.

## Time Management

Sleep trumps everything in life.
Prioritisation should be our priority as much as a paradox it sounds.
When not a [Hell Yes](Bytes/Definition-Repository.md#Hell%20Yes) â‡’ it is always a no.

## Saying no

> Learn to say a clear no. No is a complete sentence.

Having the courage to say no to good opportunities and waiting for the best

## How to Say no

### **Awkward pause** - Wait for the other Person to Continue

### Soft no

Not today but we can do at an other time in future. Prefer not doing this if we do not want to.
Another soft no is no but giving a reason of why it is a no now . Do this for urgent items else they would propose another time.
If it is a manager, ask what could i deprioritise to do this urgent task.
Offer Alternatives. I do not want to drive you. Instead of saying it directly this way we could say
"You are welcome to borrow the car. I will make the keys available."

### Hard no

Be ruthless while saying no. It is better than a half hearted engagement for any relationship.

## Uncommitment

Uncommitment is not even a word in the dictionary. It is that obscure.
Be serious in committing but do not commit if not required.
Uncommit to get ahead. Ask ourselves "What else can i do if i pull the plug on this"

Routine in an intelligent man is a sign of ambition.

> Beware the barreness of a busy life.
