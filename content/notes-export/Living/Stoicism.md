### Teachings

**On Changing Oneself**

1. How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?
2. First say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
3. Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus and live it according to Nature
**On Futility of Rumination**
1. People are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them.
2. We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
3. Let not future things disturb you, for you will come to them, if it shall be necessary, having with you the same reason which you now use for present thing
**On Shortness of Time**
1. While we wait for life, life passes.
**On Self-Introspection**
1. If a man knows not which port he sails, no wind is favourable. Have goals.
2. Ignorance is the cause of fear.
3. Knowing thyself is beginning of all wisdom
4. It is mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.
5. You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength

### Indifference

While stoicism does not endorse indifference. I find some of the teachings not very relevant to the current setting. Consider the quote by Marcus Aurelius

> Choose not to be harmed — and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed — and you haven’t been.

I do not think it is a great strategy to choose to have not been harmed. What Marcus suggest's though is learning from the mistake but choose not get disturbed. I personally feel getting disturbed is a part of learning.

### Teaching by Seneca

1. Learn to stay still in the now : Everywhere is nowhere. We must lay beside the burdens of our mind. Until then no place can satisfy us
2. Slave to anxiety, fear and regret: Two elements must therefore be rooted out once for all, —the fear of future suffering, and the recollection of past suffering; since the latter no longer concerns me, and the former concerns me not yet. Perhaps one day this sorrow might bring delight
3. Past regrets : Why do we regret the past? Because we want to avoid those mistakes in the future. What if we could just reflect on the past, learn our lessons, move on? Did i learn my lesson? Our past didn’t have the information we have now with us
4. Live for others : [Today you, Tomorrow me](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/elal2/comment/c18z0z2/). If you would be loved, love others.
5. Take action: Without a fear of failure
6. It is never too late. _He who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow. Do not spend life becoming ready to live life_

Do not procrastinate.
In your conversations, do no confuse.
In your thoughts, don’t wander.
In your soul, don’t be passive or aggressive.
In your life, don’t be all about business.
Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.
