# Luck

## What is Luck?

Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.
Apparently.

Luck is rarely a lightning strike, isolated and dramatic. It's like the wind, blowing constantly. Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it blows in gusts, Sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.

## How to Get Lucky?

### Taking Risks

Take little risks all the time. That get you out of your comfort zone.
There is a lesser spots in the world than there are people qualified for it.

There are intellectual risks, physical risks and financial risks there are emotional risks, social risks and ethical risks and political risks.

I encourage you to stretch, to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone. An emotional risk, maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel. I do this myself all the time.

Luck is all about events and people. Put yourself out there and people will find you.
One book…event…person leads to another. It's a chain reaction.

**Start with saying hello.**

### Show Appreciation

You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals. And if you don't show appreciation, not only are you not closing the loop, but you're missing an opportunity. When someone does something for you, they're taking that time that they could be spending on themselves or someone else, and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.
