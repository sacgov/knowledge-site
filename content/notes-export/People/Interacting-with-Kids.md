# Interacting with Kids

Ask what interests the kid. We might get a generic answer.
Keep asking questions until their eyes sparkle. Then deep dive.

Do not question about family/ parents to kids.
An example is _Who do you like more ? Mother or Father_ etc unless you are very close to the kid.
Very young kids do not have social constructs yet to answer generic diplomatic questions. An example is _How is life_. Instead we need to be specific and ask what they did last holiday.

1. Do you have any funny friends.
2. Show me your favourite toy/dress. What do you like about it.
3. What is your favourite TV show. Ah that villain is so mean, aren't they?

Do not engage sleepy/Hungry kids in a conversation. Let them sleep.
Always offer food to a tired kid. They might be accustomed to only ask their parents for food.

Gift happiness in the form of chocolates. But do not gift a large enough chocolate that might make the kid unhealthy. Be mindful of their parents' choices.

## Endless Why's

When a child asks an endless string of “Why?” questions, the smartest reply is “I don’t know, what do you think?
