# Company Culture

In recent times, a lot has been researched and written about attributes that make great product building cultures. Psychological safety, willingness to fail, bottoms up planning etc. The list is long. But what I have observed is that for each of these values, there is an opposite yet complementary force. Hence the Yin/Yang.

Let me explain:

1. Bottoms-up + Top-down:

This is a prime example of binary lenses people have about these attributes. Purely bottoms-up can create chaos and mandates from the top can stifle all creativity. Healthy cultures set direction but operate flat, where decisions are made close to the information.

2. Celebrate Failure + Intolerant to Incompetence

There are productive and unproductive failures. Failures that stem from bad management, badly thought out experiments, and flawed analyses should not be celebrated. Without discipline, almost anything can be justified as an experiment. Instead, a culture of competence and rigour, sets clear expectations. Excellence is key to learning from failures.

3. Psychological Safety + Radical Candor

People want to feel safe in expressing their views, having open debates and challenging authority. That’s the hallmark of psychological safety. But it is a 2-way street. If it is safe for me to criticise your ideas, it should be safe for you to criticise mine.

4. Speed + Direction:

Velocity (speed with direction) is what healthy cultures aspire to. There is no point moving fast down the wrong road. And you won’t complete the journey by simply picking the destination. You need both.

5. Collaboration + Accountability

We all want collaborative environments where people work with and help each other. But don’t confuse collaboration and consensus with clear accountability. If it belongs to everyone, it belongs to no one. Having clear accountability and a willingness to make unpopular decisions is what separates the great cultures from the rest.

Building great cultures is hard work. And more than we might realise, it requires embracing this duality. It is a constant journey to find balance between these interconnected but opposing forces.

It is a bit like our democracy. A constant battle between individual freedoms and our societal responsibilities.
