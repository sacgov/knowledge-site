# Haikyuu

1. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
2. The last ones standing are the victors. Only the strongest. If you want to be the last one standing become strong
3. Even if we’re not confident that we’ll win, even if others tell us we don’t stand a chance, we must never tell ourselves that
4. Motivation? What more do you need than pride!
5. It’s not your place to give up.
6. Being weak means that there is room to grow.
7. Do you need a reason to not want to lose?
