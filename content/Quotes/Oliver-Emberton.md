# Oliver Emberton

1. You can do anything, if you stop trying to do everything.
2. Success is your happiness measured by others, satisfaction is your happiness measured by you.
3. If your reasons are complicated, they’re almost certainly excuses.
4. If you want to follow your dreams, you have to say no to all the alternatives.
5. DO NOT FOR A SECOND believe it is enough to ‘work hard’. Hard work is not inherently a good thing. Hard work is a disgusting waste of your life when it’s thrown at the wrong things.
6. Nearly all of the damage that is done by rejection is done by ourselves, to ourselves.
7. The solution to making better choices is to impair our freedom.
8. The quality of your communication is one of the strongest indicators people will use when judging you; it can make a smart kid sound stupid, or an idiot sound vaguely intelligent.
9. The biggest difference between success and failure is total time invested.
10. There’s always tomorrow, until there’s not.
