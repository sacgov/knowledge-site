# Kunal Shah

1. We judge others by their behaviour while we judge ourselves by our intentions.
2. Truly ambitious people don’t celebrate small milestones.
3. Those who are easy to offend, attract and retain fake people around them
4. Practice without a feedback loop only results in activity and not mastery.
5. It’s hard to be a long range thinker while perpetually obsessed with current affairs.
6. Communication has to be precise
7. Those who internalise and retain extreme conclusions from past setbacks, often keep getting more rigid in life with age.
8. Those who are not actively trying to make the future interesting remain in the past.
9. If the leader of the company is often involved in solving problems that are not the hardest problems of the company, it’s either due to incompetence of the leader or having an incompetent team.
10. A leader that tolerates incompetent teams is incompetent.
11. We are the battles we choose to fight.
12. You learn more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation
13. First they laugh, then they copy.
14. Wealthy can give their kids almost everything except the struggle they faced to become who they are today.
15. Anxiety is a side effect of trying to live in future without the ability to shape it.
16. Those who trained sales early in life, learn a very important life skill: reading the room.
17. Maturity is seen in delay of reactions.
18. Those who live for validation can’t keep secrets.
19. Hiring better than you is only possible if you know yourself well.
20. An undisciplined person doing well is just a person with a gift of good judgement.
