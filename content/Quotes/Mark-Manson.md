1. Maturity is the ability to prioritise values before feelings.
2. All growth requires loss. A loss of your old values, your old behaviours, your old loves, your old identity. Therefore, growth sometimes has a component of grief to it.
3. Maturity is when you discover that the best parties in the world won’t make you as happy as going to bed by 10:30 on a Friday night.
4. People mistake comfort for happiness. They’re completely different things.
5. You will attract people of similar emotional maturity into your life. You will repel those who are more mature and be repelled by those who are less.
6. The only scarcity in life is time. The scarcity of anything else is merely a function of how we spend our time.
7. It’s rarely a problem of time, but usually a problem of priorities.
8. A good life is not a life without suffering. A good life is a life of meaningful suffering.
9. It's less about what you want and more about what you're willing to give up.
10. During difficult times, ask yourself: “What do I have to do to make this one of the best things that has ever happened to me?"
11. We overestimate what we can do in a year but underestimate what we can do in ten.
12. Regardless of what happens to you, you can always choose:
	1. How you spend your time
	2. What you pay attention to
	3. Where you direct your energy
	4. Who you choose to associate with
13. Do what we want to be done unto you
14. If you wish to be loved, then love.
15. If you wish to be appreciated, then appreciate.
16. If you wish to be respected, then respect.
17. The best way to accomplish goals is not through sheer willpower or grit, but through creating small habits and circumstances that make the goals inevitable.
18. Be a flame of positive emotions and you will never be without a friend.
19. Comfort in failure allows you to act without fear, to engage without judgment, to love without conditions.
