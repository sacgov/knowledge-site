# Camus

1. Life is meaningless, we are free to assign to any meaning to it
2. We can commit suicide or submit to faith - philosophical death
3. Acceptance - how one should lead the life. Let go of the need to assign meaning to it
4. Meaning can be whatever we choose
5. Do not make happiness a distant phenomenon. Like the process and not the result
6. We are never satisfied with things we get.
7. Not mind about the goals. We will always need more stuff.
8. Do not take things personally
9. Have the courage to be what you are and pursue things instead of feeling bad
10. To be alive means to rebel
11. Spend time with yourself
12. Be flexible and tolerant in life. Be adaptable to the changing times.
13. Nothing in life is worth turning your back on, if you love it.
