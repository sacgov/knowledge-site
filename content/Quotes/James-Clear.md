3. If something works keep doing it
4. Define yourself by effort not suffering
5. Marrying well makes everything easier
6. Motivation needs proof of progress
7. What gets measured is managed
8. Make habits attractive than build willpower
9. You don‚Äôt rise to the level of your dreams, you fall to the level of your systems
10. Decide the man I want to be. Take baby steps
11. Be kind and pleasant. Ask and follow up
12. Speak with caution like alcohol podcast
13. Consider how the other feeling right now
14. Do less. Refine what you do
15. Cast votes for your new identity. You‚Äôre not worried about getting in shape. You're focused on becoming the type of person who doesn‚Äôt miss workouts.

23. Different environments require different skillsets
24. Momentum is key
25. Sooner we make choice, sooner the adjustments
26. Have skin in the game
27. The practice gene is most potent of them all
28. When we live life as an experiment, we are far more willing to take risks, to acknowledge failure, to learn and develop. That‚Äôs what experiments are all about: discovery and growth. There is no real failure in an experiment because it‚Äôs all data. If something doesn‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs simply data that leads to changing behaviour to see if something else does work.
29. When we‚Äôre experimenting, we‚Äôre willing to do all sorts of things we might be embarrassed to do otherwise. Like ask for something when we don‚Äôt particularly ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it. Or say something in a conversation that might create a breakthrough (or might appear dumb). If it‚Äôs an experiment, then taking a risk is the win ‚Äî whether it pans out or not.
30. How to grow on Twitter:
1. Write about what fascinates you.
2. Post at least 1 tweet per day.

8. Make mistakes of ambition and not sloth
9. Things not obtained are things not attempted
10. Progress requires unlearning
11. Until we make the unconscious conscious, it will direct us and we will call it fate
12. How we divide our attention is how we divide our results
