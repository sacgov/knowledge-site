# Nn Taleb

1. Have enemies; but make sure that they think about you much, much more than you think about them.
2. Home: you are happy when you leave and you are also happy when you return.
3. As a general rule, most "regrets" after one is caught's aren't regrets about having committed the action, but regrets about having been caught.
4. For real people, if something works in theory, but not in practice, it doesn't work. For academics, if something works in practice, but not in theory, it doesn't exist.
5. It takes five years to learn how to make money; and twenty-five to learn how to not lose it.
6. You are more likely to change your mind from a bad argument from someone on your initial side than a good argument from someone on the other side.
7. When people call you intelligent it is almost always because they agree with you. Otherwise, they would call you arrogant.
8. Time spent on revenge is never wasted.
9. The rarest (and most valuable) thing on this planet: a clear mind.
10. It is a great mistake to make your enemy think that you are intelligent.
11. The most interesting thing about people is what they are trying to hide.
12. If you buy a book thinking it provides a shortcut for things in life, you are the gullible shortcut.
13. Learning to do nothing when nothing is to be done
14. People don't change their opinions when supplied with a potent argument. They change their minds when their friends change their minds.
15. To figure out if someone is an idiot, call him an idiot and check if he gets upset.
16. Missing a train is only painful if you run after it, if you allow yourself to care
17. You can stand above society, pecking order by choice, creating your own idea of success.
18. Quitting a high-paying position, if it is your decision, will seem a better payoff than the utility of the money involved (this may seem crazy, but I’ve tried it and it works). This is the first step toward the stoic’s throwing a four-letter word at fate. You have far more control over your life if you decide on your criterion by yourself.
