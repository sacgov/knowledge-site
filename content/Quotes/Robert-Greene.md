1. Remember: You choose to let things bother you.
2. Understand: People are locked in their own experiences.
3. You must not be afraid of your uniqueness and you must care less and less what people think of you.
4. Never make this mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliating people.
5. Train yourself to take nothing personally.
6. Once you learn patience, your options suddenly expand.
7. Train your eye for details—how someone tips a waiter, what delights a person, the hidden messages in clothes.
8. Understand: people judge you by appearances, the image you project through your actions, words and style
9. Keep your friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent
10. Always say less than necessary
11. Never whine, never complain, never try to justify yourself.
12. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present.
13. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others—that is too high a price to pay.
14. Half the game is keeping quiet, and carefully watching those around you.
15. When you meet a swordsman, draw your sword: Do not recite poetry to one who is not a poet.
16. The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery.
17. A person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is unworthy of respect.
18. Rationality is not a power you are born with, but one acquired by training and practice.
19. Strategy is the essence of human action—the bridge between an idea and its realisation in the world.
20. Power is a game, and in games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effects of their actions.
21. By becoming deeply aware of our mortality, we intensify our experience of every aspect of life.
22. Look at those emotions that are continually infecting your ideas and decisions.
23. Never be distracted by people’s glamorous portraits of themselves and their lives; search and dig for what really imprisons them.
24. Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses.
25. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work—it only raises questions.
26. No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you.
27. Your days are numbered. Will you pass them half awake and halfhearted or will you live with a sense of urgency?
28. Learn to use the knowledge of the past and you will look like a genius, even when you are really just a clever borrower
29. Once people know what pleases you and what angers you, they turn into trained poodles, working to charm you with apparent good behaviour.
30. Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.
