# Forgiving My Younger Self

Realised that hating my past self was also wasting my life. So if I continued to do it, I hadn't really changed or improved. I was still the same person, wasting my remaining life

My younger self did not have the financial means. Probably he could have taken those risks and they would have paid off. So not taking risks was a mistake here.

Let myself feel emotions, to empathise with that version of myself, to ask questions and most of all, give that person love and forgiveness.

Why did not we have greater foresight ? How can we have slip up so bad?
We are human and are doomed to slip up. We cannot know who we should marry
We do not know our career not our the economy. We look at where we have ended up and compare with more fortunate places of others

We must have been more stupider than then. There has been people who were hasty but have passed unmolested. In assessing of destiny, we should check our luck.
We look enviously for people currently riding high.

Human condition is seldom a smiling one.

There are people who have worked as much as us but failed.
They many seem equal to us but they belong to a more blessed cohort.

We just do not know what others hide. Everyone is stupid in their own way.

Mistakes were made. More will be made in the future, as long as you live.

Regret is a waste of energy and focus

I resent your younger self for denying access to different opportunities, journeys/ life paths.

Be kind and understanding to your introverted, anxiety ridden, and closed minded younger self because you know all of the pains, fears, and traumas that they experienced that shaped them into the person they were. You are no longer that person but you are also the only person on the planet that can truly empathise with them and know all of the ways they suffered.

Not successful enough
Relationships not good enough
Outwards with envy, inwards with dissatisfaction.
Have a dream job, have great experiences, be attractive and find a soulmate and that others have these, they are truly happy.

At first you were worried you’d ruin your life. Now you’re worried you’ll waste your life

Most people who are successful in life had really stable family backgrounds or at least financial wealth to offset any instability.

I think a good first step is too ditch all social media.

Why people study for IAS. To become something in their lives. I did not go for MS or higher studies. I would have to stay in this position. Doing something is finding opportunity.

Which i did for 5 years in yellow. But did not benefit exactly from it.

A man is never happy, but spends his whole life in striving after something that he thinks will make him so; he seldom attains his goal, and when he does, it is only to be disappointed; he is mostly shipwrecked in the end, and comes into harbour with mast and rigging gone. And then, it is all one whether he is happy or miserable; for his life was never anything more than a present moment always vanishing; and now it is over.

It was easier for people to be good at something when more of us lived in small, rural
Communities. In the small circle we can be the best amongst our peers.
Now the comparison has been dizzyingly vertical. We compare ourselves with someone in the US. They are successful in their small village too. But it just so happens their village is already wildly successful compared to ours.

No matter how good you are at something, or how you rank your accomplishments,
There is someone out there who makes you look incompetent.

Some Mafia don has a tackier yacht
Who cares if you are prime minister of Canada when someone else is the POTUS

Inside us dwells a critical internal voice and spirit that knows all this. It’s predisposed
To make its noisy case. It condemns our mediocre efforts. It can be very difficult to quell.

Mediocrity has consequences both real and harsh.
We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.
The winners don’t take all, but they take most, and the bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there.

Worthlessness is the default condition.
If the critical voice within says the same denigrating things about everyone, no matter how successful, how reliable can it be? Maybe its comments are chatter, not wisdom

Standards of better or worse are not illusory or unnecessary. Value judgments are a
Precondition for action. Furthermore, every activity, once chosen, comes with its own
Internal standards of accomplishment. If something can be done at all, it can be done
Better or worse

To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail. There are many
Games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve
You productively with other people, sustain or even improve themselves across time

You have a career and friends and family members and personal projects and artistic endeavours and athletic pursuits. You might consider judging your success across all the games you play. Imagine that you are very good at some, middling at others, and terrible at the remainder. Perhaps that’s how it should be. You might object: I should be winning at everything! Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult

Your colleague outperforms you at work. His wife, however, is having an affair, while your marriage is stable and happy. Who has it better? The celebrity you admire is a chronic drunk driver and bigot. Is his life truly preferable to yours?

First, the internal critic selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power). Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant. Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain. It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life. That way your motivation to do anything at all can be most effectively undermined.

We live within a framework that defines the present as eternally lacking and the future as eternally better. If we did not see things this way, we would not act at all. We wouldn’t even be able to see, because to see we must focus, and to focus we must pick one thing above all else on which to focus.

The future is like the past. But there’s a crucial difference. The past is fixed, but the future—it could be better. It could be better, some precise amount—the amount that can be achieved, perhaps, in a day, with some minimal engagement. The present is eternally flawed. But where you start might not be as important as the direction you are heading. Perhaps happiness is always to be found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak. Much of happiness is hope, no matter how deep the underworld in which that hope was conceived.

What snakes might I banish from my closet—and my mind?”
Five hundred small decisions, five hundred tiny actions, compose your day, today and every day. Could you aim one or two of these at a better result?
Better, in your own private opinion, by your own individual standards?
Could you compare your specific personal tomorrow with your specific personal yesterday?
Could you use your own judgment, and ask yourself what that better tomorrow might be?

You do the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that’s magic. That’s compound interest.

Do that for three years, and your life will be entirely different. Now you’re aiming for something higher.

What you aim determines what you see

Our refusal to forgive ourselves depends on how easily it would have been avoidable.
Since this serves as a lesson we could easily follow in the future.
If only we had not been so clueless and witless.
We experience recurring jabs of pain at the disjuncture between the agonising present ad the vanished alternative.
How could we have been no indiscreet
How did we have so little self restraint
We also add to injury by comparing to the people above us
There are people who were as hasty as us but in better conditions as the events favoured their condition.

Pay attention. Focus on your surroundings, physical and psychological. Notice something
That bothers you, that concerns you, that will not let you be, which you could fix, that you
Would fix.

What is it that is bothering me?
Is that something I could fix?
Would I actually be willing to fix it?

Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.
