# Chatter

## What is Chatter ?

Alongside the unremarkable musings in our brain were monologues negotiating a host of personal wounds, distresses, and worries. The narrations often landed on negative content with utterly no transition, like a gaping pothole appearing suddenly on the road of thought.

Internal monologue dipped back in time, with reflections about the decisions that shaped our life to its current state.

## How is Chatter Created ?

Our Parents might have repeatedly told us to never give up after a disappointment. Over time, we repeat these things to ourselves, and they begin to shape our own verbal streams.

Spontaneous thoughts related to goals are among the most frequent kind that fill our mind. It’s our inner voice alerting us to pay attention to an objective.

Part of reaching goals involves making the right choice when there is a proverbial fork in the road, which is why our inner voice also allows us to run mental simulations

## Social Support and Speaking to Others

People feel compelled to talk to others about their negative experiences. But that wasn’t all. The more intense the emotion was, the more they wanted to talk about it. Additionally, they returned to talking about what had occurred more often, doing so repeatedly over the course of hours, days, weeks, and months, and sometimes even for the remainder of their lives.

The only exceptions to this rule were cases in which people felt shame, which they often wished to conceal, or certain forms of trauma, which they wanted to avoid dwelling on.

## Effect of Social Media

Social media also allows us to shape what we want other people to believe is happening in our lives, and our choices about what to post can fuel other people’s chatter. The human need to self-present is powerful.

We craft our appearances to influence how people perceive us all the time. This has always been the case, but then along came social media to give us exponentially more control over how we do this. It allows us to skill fully curate the presentations of our lives—the proverbial photoshopped version of life, with the low points and less aesthetically pleasing moments left out. Engaging in this self-presentation exercise can make us feel better, satisfying our own need to appear positively in the eyes of others and buoying our inner voice.

But there’s a catch. Although posting glamour shots of our lives may lead us to feel better, that very same act can cause the users who view our posts to feel worse.

## Distraction

Chatter also leads us to displace our aggression against people when they don’t deserve it. Our boss upsets us, for example, and we take it out on our kids. The main culprit in keeping stress active is our negative verbal stream

One of the dominant approaches to battling inner-voice rumination is distraction.
This can take forms of food, TV shows or exercise. In worse case smoking, drugs etc.

## Example - Losing Perspective

Tracey a high schooler in the US took up NSA’s scholarship. NSA would pay for her college and she in turn would work for NSA later on after graduation.
She could major only in a handful of subjects that were central to the NSA’s interests: subjects like electrical engineering, computer science, and math. She couldn’t date or maintain close friendships with students from other countries. She couldn’t study abroad. She was discouraged from playing varsity sports. Slowly but surely Tracey’s scholarship, her golden ticket, was morphing into a pair of golden handcuff.
She felt as if she had two options: fail out or drop out.
We lose perspective. This dramatically narrowed view of one’s situation magnifies adversity and allows the negative side of the inner voice to play, enabling rumination and its companions: stress, anxiety, and depression. Read more about [Scarcity](Improving-Thinking/Scarcity.md)

## Temporal Distancing

We don’t see ourselves with the same distance and insight with which we see others.
Because you don’t know what you don’t know, this often leads to inaccurate predictions. About potential obstacles. The outside view, on the other hand, includes a broader sample of possibilities and thus more accuracy. You’re able to better foresee obstacles and prepare accordingly
Mentally time traveling into the future, is a tool called temporal distancing. Studies show that when people are going through a difficult experience, asking them to imagine how they’ll feel about it ten years from now, rather than tomorrow, can be another remarkably effective.
Doing so leads people to understand that their experiences are temporary, which provides them with hope.

### Change is Inevitable

In a certain sense, then, what temporal distancing promotes is one of the facets of wisdom: the understanding that the world is constantly in flux and circumstances are going to change. Recognising that feature of life when it comes to negative experiences can be tremendously alleviating

### Threat Vs Challenge

When you place people in stressful situations, one of the first things they do is ask themselves (usually subconsciously) two questions:

1. What is required of me in these circumstances ?
2. Do I have the personal resources to cope with what’s required?

We scan the situation and conclude that we don’t have the wherewithal needed to handle things, that leads us to appraise the stress as a **threat**. If, on the other hand, we appraise the situation and determine that we have what it takes to respond adequately, then we think of it as a **challenge**.

### Normalising Experiences

There is a potent psychological comfort that comes from normalising experiences, from knowing that what you’re experiencing isn’t unique to you, but rather something everyone experiences—that, unpleasant as it is, it’s just the stuff of life. When we are going through grief, relationship turbulence, professional setbacks, parenting struggles, or other types of adversity, we often feel agonisingly alone, zoomed in as we are on our problems. Yet when we talk with others and learn that they have faced similar challenges, we realise that as hard as the experience is, it happens to other people, which gives an immediate sense of perspective. If other people got through this hardship, our internal dialogue now reasons with us, then so can I. What felt extraordinary, it turns out, is in fact ordinary. This offers relief
Sharing our emotions with others makes us feel closer to and more supported by the people we open up to. But the ways most of us commonly talk and listen to each other do little to reduce our chatter. Quite frequently, they exacerbate it.
In other words, when we’re upset, we tend to over focus on receiving empathy rather than finding practical solutions.

## Affectionate touch

Research shows that when people feel the welcome, affectionate touch or embrace of those they are close, they often interpret that as a sign that they are safe, loved, and supported. Caring physical contact from people we know and trust lowers our biological threat response, improves our ability to deal with stress, promotes relationship satisfaction, and reduces feelings of loneliness. It also activates the brain’s reward circuitry and triggers the release of stress-relieving neurochemicals such as oxytocin and endorphins.
Affectionate touch is so potent, in fact, that one set of studies found that a mere one second of contact on the shoulder led people with low self-esteem to be less anxious about death and feel more connected with others
In this sense, our contact with others is part of an ongoing nonverbal conversation that can benefit our emotion. Though employing them on people we love takes a certain art, not to mention practice

## Pain

We experience pain for a reason. It warns us of danger, signalling us to take action. This process provides us with a tremendous survival advantage. In fact, each year a small number of people are born with a genetic mutation that makes it impossible for them to feel pain.
This phenomenon mirrors the indispensability of the harsh side of our inner voice. It can cloud our thoughts with negative emotions, but if we didn’t have this critical self-reflective capacity, we’d have a difficult time learning, changing, and improving

## Tools You Can Implement on Your Own

The ability to step back from the echo chamber of our own minds so we can adopt a broader, calmer, and more objective perspective is an important tool for combating chatter.

1. **Use distanced self-talk**. When you’re trying to work through a difficult experience, use your name and the second-person you to refer to yourself. Doing so is linked with less activation in brain networks associated with rumination and leads to improved performance under stress, wiser thinking, and less negative emotion.
2. **Imagine advising a friend**. Think about the advice you’d give that person, and then apply it to yourself. Adopt the perspective of a neutral third party.
3. **Broaden your perspective**. Chatter involves narrowly focusing on the problems we’re experiencing. A natural antidote to this involves broadening our perspective. To do this, think about how the experience you’re worrying about compares with other adverse events you (or others) have endured, how it fits into the broader scheme of your life and the world, and/or how other people you admire would respond to the same situation.
4. **Reframe an experience as a challeng**e. You possess the ability to change the way you think about your experiences. Chatter is often triggered when we interpret a situation as a threat—something we can’t manage. To aid your inner voice, reinterpret the situation as a challenge that you can handle, for example, by reminding yourself of how you’ve succeeded in similar situations in the past, or by using distanced self-talk.
5. **Reinterpret your body’s chatter response**. Your bodily response to stress is an adaptive evolutionary reaction that improves performance under high-stress conditions. In other words, tell yourself that your sudden rapid breathing, pounding heartbeat, and sweaty palms are there not to sabotage you but to help you respond to a challenge.
6. **Normalise your experience**. Use the word **you** to refer to people in general when you think and talk about negative experiences. Doing so helps people reflect on their experiences from a healthy distance and makes it clear that what happened is not unique to them but characteristic of human experience in general.
7. **Engage in mental time travel**. Think about how you’ll feel a month, a year, or even longer. Remind yourself that looking back on what is upsetting you will seem much less upsetting in the future. Doing so highlights the impermanence of your current emotional state.
8. **Change the view**. As you think about a negative experience, visualise the event in your mind from the perspective of a fly on the wall peering down on the scene. Try to understand why your distant self is feeling the way it is. Adopting this perspective leads people to focus less on the emotional features of their experience and more on reinterpreting the event in ways that promote insight and closure. You can also gain distance through visual imagery by imagining moving away from the upsetting scene in your mind’s eye, panning out until the scene shrinks to the size of a postage stamp
9. **Write expressively.** Write about your deepest thoughts and feelings surrounding your negative experience for fifteen to twenty minutes a day for one to three consecutive days. Really let yourself go as you jot down your stream of thoughts; don’t worry about grammar or spelling. Focusing on your experience from the perspective of a narrator provides you with distance from the experience, which helps you make sense of what you felt in ways that improve how you feel over time.
10. **Perform a ritual**. Performing a ritual—a fixed sequence of behaviours that is infused with meaning—provides people with a sense of order and control that can be helpful when they’re experiencing chatter. Although many of the rituals we engage in (for example, silent prayer, meditation) are passed down to us from our families.

## Providing Chatter Support

1. **Address people’s emotional and cognitive needs**.
    1. Searching for care and support emotional needs
    2. Concrete advice to move forward and gain closure, on the other (cognitive needs).
Concretely, this involves not only empathically validating what people are going through but also broadening their perspective, providing hope, and normalising their experience.
2. **Provide invisible support**.
Offering advice can backfire when people don’t ask for help; it threatens people’s sense of self-efficacy and autonomy. Providing support invisibly, without people being aware you’re helping them, is useful. One approach involves covertly providing practical support, like cleaning up the house without being asked. Another involves For example, if my colleague was struggling to connect with their graduate student and we found ourselves at a function with other advisers, I might casually ask a group whether they’ve experienced trouble connecting with their students and, if so, how they managed the situation.
Tell your kids to pretend they’re a superhero. This strategy, famous as the Batman effect, is a distancing strategy that is particularly useful for children grappling with intense emotions. Ask them to pretend they’re a superhero or cartoon character they admire, and then nudge them to refer to themselves using that character’s name when they’re confronting a difficult situation. Doing so helps them distance.
3. **Touch affectionately (but respectfully)**.
Feeling the warm embrace of a person we love, whether that be holding someone’s hand or sharing a hug, reminds us at the conscious level that we have supportive people in our lives whom we can lean on—a chatter-relieving psychological reframe. Affectionate touch also unconsciously triggers the release of endorphins and other chemicals in the brain such as oxytocin that reduce stress. Of course, for affectionate touch to be effective it has to be welcome.
4. **Be someone else’s placebo**.
Utilise this interpersonal healing pathway by providing the people you’re advising with an optimistic outlook that their conditions will improve, which changes their expectations for how their chatter will progress.

## Receiving Chatter Support

1. **Build a board of advisers**. Finding the right people to talk to, those who are skilled at satisfying both your emotional and your cognitive needs, is the first step to leveraging the power of others. Depending on the domain in which you’re experiencing chatter, different people will be uniquely equipped to do this. A colleague for at advising you on work problems, a partner to advise you on interpersonal dilemmas.
2. **Seek out physical contact**. You don’t have to wait for someone to give you affectionate touch or supportive physical contact. Knowing their benefits, you can seek them out yourself, by asking trusted people in your life for a hug or a simple hand squeeze. Moreover, you need not even touch another human to reap these benefits. Embracing a comforting inanimate object, like a teddy bear or security blanket, is helpful too.
3. **Look at a photo of a loved one**. Thinking about others who care about us reminds us that there are people we can turn to for support during times of emotional distress. Looking at photos of loved ones soothes our inner voice when we are consumed with chatter.
4. **Perform a ritual with others**. Communal meditation or prayer, a team’s pregame routine, or even just toasting drinks with friends can reduce loneliness
5. **Minimise passive social media**. Voyeuristically scrolling through the curated news feeds of others on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media platforms can trigger self-defeating, envy-inducing thought spirals. One way to mitigate this outcome is to curb your passive social media usage. Use these technologies actively instead to connect with others at opportune times.

## Tools that Involve the Environment

1. **Create order in your environment**. When we experience chatter, we often feel as if we are losing control. Our thought spirals control us rather than the other way around. When this happens, you can boost your sense of control by imposing order. Organising your environment can take many forms. Tidying up your work or home spaces, making a list. Organising your space to help provide you with a sense of mental order.
2. **Increase your exposure to green spaces**. Spending time in green spaces helps replenish the brain’s limited attentional reserves. Go for a walk in a tree-lined street or park when you’re experiencing chatter. If that’s not possible, watch a film clip of nature on your computer, stare at a photograph of a green scene, or even listen to natural sounds.
3. **Seek out awe-inspiring experiences**. Feeling awe allows us to transcend our current concerns in ways that put our problems in perspective. Find what evokes awe within you, and cultivate that emotion when you find your internal dialogue spiralling. Think about creating spaces around you that elicit feelings of awe each time you glance at them.

## Questions to Ask Oneself

Our mind is like an instrument. It has its thoughts and can be tuned

Shift negative voice and stories to positive ones. A lot of people won't believe in us, maybe close family and friends - "Wow, that's a great idea but here's a long list of why that won't work."

Three questions to ask:

1. Is it the truth?
2. Is it necessary?
3. Does is improve upon the silence?
