# Acceptance

**Note to Myself**

Do not take all concepts of acceptance seriously. This interpretation of acceptance is buddhist and heavily draws from the teaching of [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh) and [Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn)

I think giving accepting things we cannot change has merit but absolving oneself of all desires is becoming a monk which is not what i aspire to. If something is not acceptable, try to change it rather accepting the situation. Counter intuitively accepting the situation at hand empowers us better to change it.

## Basic Misunderstanding

That we should try to be better than we already are, that we should try to improve ourselves, that we should try to get away from painful things, and that if we could just learn how to get away from the painful things, then we would be happy.

If we’re committed to comfort at any cost, as soon as we come up against the least edge of pain, we’re going to run; we’ll never know what’s beyond that particular barrier or wall or fearful thing

## What is Meditation

The point is not to try to change ourselves. Isn’t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It’s about befriending who we are already.

To take an interest in ourselves, to investigate and be inquisitive about self.

## Gentleness

Gentleness is a sense of goodheartedness toward ourselves.
Being able to see very clearly, not being afraid to see what’s really there,
Making friends with yourself.

## Resentment and Arrogance

One of the major obstacles to what is traditionally called enlightenment is resentment, feeling cheated, holding a grudge about who you are, what you are.

Arrogance is just a cover-up for really feeling that you’re the worst horse, and always trying to prove otherwise

We must see our so-called limitations with clarity, precision, gentleness, kindness.
Having seen them fully, then let go, open further, we begin to find that our world is vast, refreshing and more fascinating than we had realised before.

Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment. Instead of the resentment being an obstacle, it’s a reminder. Feeling irritated, restless, afraid, and hopeless is a reminder to listen more carefully. It’s a reminder to stop talking; watch and listen. It’s a reminder to use [Tonglen](Mental-Wellness/Acceptance.md#Tonglen%20) practice.

## Why is Desire to Change Bad

The problem is that the desire to change is fundamentally a form of aggression toward yourself.
Resentment, bitterness, and holding a grudge prevent us from seeing and hearing and tasting and delighting.
Acknowledging the preciousness of each day is a good way to live, a good way to reconnect with our basic joy

## Now

Now, now, now. Mindfulness trains you to be awake and alive,
That’s the challenge of now: What are you going to do with what you have already—your body, your speech, your mind

## Making Friends with Our Issues

It does take coming to know your anger, coming to know your self-deprecation, coming to know your craving and wanting, coming to know your boredom, and making friends with those things.

> There is nothing good or bad, only thinking makes it so - William Shakespeare.

It is difficult to understand this in difficult times

## Being Awake

Life’s work is to wake up, to let the things that enter into the circle wake you up rather than put you to sleep.

The only way to do this is to open, be curious, and develop a sense of sympathy for everything that comes along, to know its nature and let it teach you what it will.

It’s going to stick around until you learn your lesson, at any rate.

You can leave your marriage, you can quit your job, you can only go where people are going to praise you, you can manipulate your world until you’re blue in the face to try to make it always smooth, but the same old demons will always come up until finally you have learned your lesson, the lesson they came to teach you.

Then the same demons will appear as friendly, warmhearted companions of life.

## Why Beliefs Are Harmful

Holding on to beliefs limits our experience of life. Beliefs or ideas are not a problem; the stubborn attitude of wanting things in a particular way cause the problems.
Coming back to present moment.
Acknowledge thoughts without judging them as right or wrong.
Let go and come back to the present moment.

Whatever comes up, see what is without calling it right or wrong. Acknowledge it. See it clearly without judgment and let it go. Come back to the present moment.

From now until the moment of your death, you could do this.

As a way of becoming more compassionate toward yourself and toward others, as a way of becoming less dogmatic, prejudiced, determined to have your own way, absolutely sure that you’re right and the other person is wrong, as a way to develop a sense of humour about the whole thing, to lighten up, open up, you could do this.

## Discomforts

1. Nothing more, nothing less; just your interpretation of reality
2. It’s part of being human to feel discomfort. We don’t even have to call it suffering anymore, we don’t even have to call it discomfort.
3. Resistance is the fundamental operating mechanism of what we call ego, that resisting life causes suffering. Traditionally it’s said that the cause of suffering is clinging to our narrow view.
4. Cessation of suffering is letting go of holding on to ourselves
5. Resting the mind: Train yourself not to be distracted by every little thing
6. Natively resting - When your mind wanders off, without making any big deal whatsoever, simply come back
7. Taming the mind - Develop a nonaggressive attitude to thoughts in your mind.

## Numbing Emotions

Do not numb, stay in bed, eat or walk.
Always take action to fix the life.
A day in the sheets is what it is. Is my future bright if i spend in in the bed mulling.

## Renunciation

Renunciation is seeing clearly how we hold back, how we pull away, how we shut down, how we close off, and then learning how to open.

It’s already a sign of your aliveness and the fact that you’ve shed a lot, that you can see so clearly and so vividly.

## Tonglen

Tonglen practice has to do with cultivating fearlessness
I had secretly hoped that if I did the practice I can escape pain anymore.

Suppose there’s someone in your life that you can’t stand, the very thought of whom brings up all kinds of negative feelings. You decide to do tonglen to work with feeling in that particular situation. When you’re breathing in, you connect with them—their quality and texture and just how they grab your heart. It’s not that you try to figure them out; you just feel the pain.

Then on the out-breath you relax, let go, open up, ventilate the whole thing. But you don’t immerse in that for very long because when you breathe in again, it’s back to the painful feeling. You don’t get completely trapped, drowned in that, because next you breathe out—you open and relax and share some sense of space again.

Maybe you want to grasp on to the joy, but then you breathe in again. Maybe you want to dwell in the pain, but then you breathe out again

Only obstacle is ignorance.

Basically what we work with is our fear and our holding back, which are not necessarily obstacles. The only obstacle is ignorance, this refusal to look at our unfinished business. It appears in many forms: as the lover who jilted us, as the parent who never loved us enough, as someone who abused us

Start taking off that armour while fighting your dragons

There are a lot of people suffering like this, and if I can do it, they can do it.

## Dig Yourself Our of Your Coffin

I’m just talking about seeing how you always do the same habitual things when bad feelings—uneasiness, depression, fear—start coming up.

You always do the same thing; you shut down in some habitual, very old way

Every action has a result. If you stay in bed all day with the covers over your head, if you overeat for the millionth time in your life, if you get drunk, if you get stoned, you know that’s going to depress you and make you more discouraged

When you find yourself in a dark place where you’ve been countless times, you can think, It’s time to get a little golden spade and dig myself out of this place.

## Compassion

It is unconditional compassion for ourselves that leads naturally to unconditional compassion for others. If we are willing to stand fully in our own shoes and never give up on ourselves, then we will be able to put ourselves in the shoes of others and never give up on them



No escape, no problem - Practice Tonglen

We already have everything we need. There is no need for self-improvement. All these trips that we lay on ourselves—the heavy-duty fearing that we’re bad and hoping that we’re good, the identities that we so dearly cling to, the rage, the jealousy and the addictions of all kinds—never touch our basic wealth.

Being warm and understanding toward ourselves when we suffer, fail, or feel inadequate, rather than ignoring our pain or flagellating ourselves with self-criticism.
Every time you choose to be kind to yourself rather than critical, you heal.

## Mind Training - Shedding Armour

You wonder why you made much ado about nothing. It also happens when you fall in love with somebody; you’re so completely into thinking about the person twentyfour hours a day.

You are haunted and you want him or her so badly. Then a little while later, I don’t know where we went wrong, but the feeling’s gone and I just can’t get it back.

We all know this feeling of how we make things a big deal and then realise that we’re making a lot out of nothing.

The armours we erect around our soft hearts causes a lot of misery.

Shield is just made up of thoughts that we churn out and regard as solid. The shield is not made out of iron. In fact, it’s made out of passing memory.

## The Three Poisons

Craving, aversion, and ignorance are the three poisons
Don’t try to make these unwanted feelings go away.
You could be sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon

**Craving**: All you can see is this piece of chocolate cake that you’re craving.
**Aversion**: All you can hear is the angry words you said to someone ten years ago. **Ignorance**: A paper bag covers your head.

## Antidote to Poisons - Bodhichitta

Underneath all that craving or aversion or jealousy or feeling wretched about yourself, underneath all that hopelessness and despair and depression, there’s something extremely soft, which is called Bodhichitta.

When these things arise, train gradually and very gently without making it into a big deal. Begin to get the hang of feeling what’s underneath the story line. Feel the wounded heart that’s underneath the addiction, self-loathing, or anger.

It’s as if you pick up hot coals with your bare hands and throw them at your enemy. If the coals happen to hit him, he will be hurt. But in the meantime, you are guaranteed to be burned.

## Letting Go

This not that easy. That light touch of acknowledging what we’re thinking and letting it go is the key to connecting with this wealth that we have

To begin to develop compassion for yourself and others, you have to unlock the door. You don’t open it yet, because you have to work with your fear that somebody you don’t like might come in. Then as you begin to relax and befriend those feelings, you begin to open it.

I’m not going away and it looks like you’re not either, so let’s just live here together

When the resistance is gone, so are the demons.

You use specific instances of misery and pain as a stepping stone for understanding the universal suffering of people and animals everywhere.

There is a story we tell ourselves. We fall into a pothole. We lose track. We find ourselves stuck in our story. The story is not just what happened to us. The story is us

1. Linear life is dead
2. Life is a deck of disruptions and transitions.
3. Develop skills to cope with our emotions
4. Seek wisdom from others
5. Rewrite our story

## Why Do We not like Some People

If we were to make a list of people we don’t like— people we find obnoxious, threatening, or worthy of contempt—we would find out a lot about those aspects of ourselves that we can’t face. If we were to come up with one word about each of the troublemakers in our lives, we would find ourselves with a list of descriptions of our own rejected qualities, which we project onto the outside world. The people who repel us unwittingly show us the aspects of ourselves that we find unacceptable, which otherwise we can’t see.

Steps to a good practice

1. Accumulating merit : Be willing to give, willing to open, willing not to hold back. It is described as letting go of holding on to yourself, letting your stronghold of ego go. Instead of collecting things for yourself, you open and give them away.
2. If it’s better for me to be sick, so be it. If it’s better for me to recover, so be it. If it’s better for me to die, so be it.
3. Surrendering, letting go of possessiveness, and complete non attachment
4. **Regret** implies that you’re tired of armouring yourself, tired of talking to yourself for hours each time, tired of this constant complaint to yourself. Nobody else has to give you a hard time. Nobody has to tell you. Through keeping your eyes open, you yourself get tired of your neurosis. That’s the idea of regret.
5. **Refraining** from doing it again: It’s gentle; at the very most, you say to yourself, One day at a time. Not indulging in destructive behaviours
6. **Remedial activity** : You can practice because you have respect for yourself,
7. **Complete willingness** to continue in the future and not act foolish
8. Don’t wallow in self-pity.

Stop struggling against the fact that things are slipping through our fingers.

## Five Teachings to Lead a Good Life

1. Strong determination. Not doggedly pushing through, strong determination involves connecting with joy, relaxing, and trusting. To use every challenge as an opportunity to open your heart and soften, and not to withdraw. Develop a strong-hearted spiritual appetite. To do this, playful quality is needed. When you wake up in the morning, I wonder what’s going to happen today. This may be the day that I die.
2. Familiarisation: When i don’t have to search any further, and I know it. I learn the pleasantness of the presentness.
3. Seed of Virtue: It’s about precision and seeing clearly. Not searching. Searching prevents us from ever finding it.
4. Reproach: Look ahead to the rest of your life and ask yourself what you want it to add up to.
5. Aspiration : empowering yourself, not about getting what you want

## Why We Should not Look to Change

Sooner or later you will find yourself in a situation where you can’t change the outer circumstances at all, and you realise it all comes down to how you relate to things

As long as you are wishing for things to change, they never will.
As long as you’re wanting yourself to get better, you won’t.

As long as you have an orientation toward the future, you can never just relax into what you already have or already are.

We think of the past a lot, which maybe was better than now, or worse. We also think ahead quite a bit to the future, which we may fear—always holding out hope that it might be a little bit better than now.

Even if now is going really well. There’s a deep tendency to think on how it’s going.
We don’t quite give ourselves full credit for who we are in the present.

## We Will Never Attain Ground - Disappointment

You can always be [Thinner, Look Better](Bytes/Links-Repository.md#Thinner%20,%20Look%20Better). But somehow there’s almost always a sense of disappointment, a sense of things not completely measuring up

You’re never going to get it all together. There isn’t going to be some precious future time when all the loose ends will be tied up

Not letting go of what we have. But this is hard to swallow if what you have is pain.

You’re always going to be approaching your problem with the very same logic that created it to begin with: you’re not good enough.

Abandon Fruition

Abandon any hope of fruition.

Fruition implies that at a future time you will feel good.

The reason it’s uncomfortable is that you can’t get away from yourself there on a dopamine detox

Cultivate patience

How not to think

1. Do not compare of other people
2. Do not put down other people
3. Do not malign others
4. Do not respond predictably to pleasure and pain
5. Do not humiliate people
6. Do not wait in ambush, for the right time to get back
7. Do not transfer the ox’s load to the cow
8. Do not seek others’ pain as a way to get happiness for yourself
9. Do not vacillate under external situations
10. Do not expect applause

## Happiness & Buddhism - Individual Self

### What is Happiness?

Happiness is when we do not want to be in an other state. We are not restless and anxious. We are completely engaged in your direct experience. It occurs when we are making love, rock climbing, It is about being in the zone.
We are not comparing myself to some other person when we are in this flow.

### Negative Emotion

**Shame** : The desire to hide, cover up and lie as we feel defective and inferior to others
**Guilt** : Desire to repair bad action as we feel responsible for what we are
**Envy** : Motivation to destroy, diminish what others have as we could never have it
**Jealousy**: Desire to compete and get what others have as we think we could get it if we tried

And every now and then, it will feel like more than enough.

## Story of Letting Go

[Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirKw3mWB3I)

This is a transcript. I refers to the lady in that above talk.

The lady was in a relationship where the guy did not commit to marriage. He did not have any skin in the game. He was a good looking, smart, reliable, and sensitive guy who cared, and while our relationship wasn't perfect, it worked in theory.

Letting go can make you unstoppable.
Letting go can create the best of change for each and everyone of you.

She could either stay with a man who couldn't commit, but was great on all the holidays and birthdays, or I could break up with him and be alone.

She let go of the fear that I would grow old and die alone, that my friends would use me as a cautionary tale, that it was too late for me.

## Storytelling

This is also related to [Reframing](Habits-Behaviour/ACT-Acceptance-Therapy.md#Reframing).
The story you tell yourself about yourself.
Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.
It helps you understand how you became you.

But we don't always realise that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them.

Your life isn't just a list of events.
You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts.

Christopher Reeves was Superman. He was then paralysed.
He felt "My life was good. Now it's bad."
I would say it was not just good but great. He was superman.

But with time, he had to weave a different story.
Reeves started spreading awareness on , and he discovered what his purpose was: Disability Activism.

This a "redemptive story,"

People leading meaningful lives tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love.

But what makes people change their stories?
Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too,
Just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you,

What you lost, what you gained.
You won't change your story overnight; It could take years and be painful.
After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.

But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you.

## Pillars of Happiness

### Belonging

Belonging comes from being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically. I think we all reject people in small ways without realising it. I do.
I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me. These acts devalue others.
They make them feel invisible and unworthy.
But when you lead with love, you create a bond that lifts each of you up.
Belonging is the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends.

### Purpose

Finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy.
Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.
Some "why" that drives you forward.

### Transcendence

Transcendent states are those rare moments . This is awe. When you're lifted above, the hustle and bustle of daily life. Your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected to a higher reality.

One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute.
But afterwards they felt less self-centred, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone.

**Mindset**

Author met a one-legged taxi driver in Kenya, and Sonia an orphan school girl in Rwanda. He found their happiness confronting far more confronting than poverty.

We're unhappy when our expectations of reality exceed our experiences of reality

Our imagination exceeds reality you see when we choose to buy goods we choose from a range of options when we choose where to travel to, we think will be the best which is the one that we imagine will be the best of all the options and so what we do is that we try to maximize our utility at a given price that's how most people make decisions to do otherwise would be to

Digitally enhanced photos is what we think of when we travel.
We think the Taj Mahal is always like that.

Technology does is that it skews our vision and distorts reality and makes the unreal seem real indeed

Many of the times that when we're happiest when we go traveling are actually the times when we stumble across things we didn't expect.

Politicians often get elected on the basis of promising things that they can't deliver by raising our expectations.

More likely to vote for a politician that says I'll fix your problems if you vote for me or someone who says perhaps more honestly things will probably be the same whether you vote for me or not.

Advertisers showing only the best before-and-after photos what we see is pictures of models

### Inter-personal Gap

where we compare our reality to the reality of social media image projected. [Social Media effects](Mental-Wellness/Chatter.md#Effect%20of%20Social%20Media)
We're actually happier when we're with worse looking people because we're perceived by others to be objectively better

We prioritise we focus on one end of the spectrum we focus on the rich the famous the beautiful and pay less attention to the other end and so we're made to seem poorer. We're made to feel less successful than we actually are.

### Inter-temporal Gap

We're unhappy when our past reality is better than our present reality.

They're one-of-a-kind that they're amazing and that they can be the next Mark Zuckerberg. We raise their expectations and so when that child gets a normal job when they start a business and it fails like most do they are broken.

Expectations are largely determined by what we consider to be normal.

What we considered to be normal is largely based on our imagination based on others around us and based on our past.

So we have these constant battles the battle between our imagination and our reality the battle between the reality that we experience and what we think or perceive that others experience, a battle between our reality and our past reality.

It's important that we make it known to content providers the importance of actually having realistic representations of images people and places and events and we might even go so far as to ban things like digital enhancement in ads.

Bronze medalist can be happier than a silver medalist because the silver medalist imagines coming first the bronze medalist imagines coming fourth.
