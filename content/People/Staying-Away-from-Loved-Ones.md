# Staying away from Loved Ones

## Cost of Immigration

The cost of immigration is high. My parents moved to a different city for work.
It definitely paid us better money.

> Money often costs too much.

## Missing Cousin time

We were away for most family occasions as it was far to visit. A visit was warranted only for special occasions. These occasions tend to large gatherings where everyone is hurry and the by the end of it, invariably tired.

This leaves little time for connection.

I am now making it a point to attend _silly_ or smaller parties like a kid's birthday. Though these are not obligatory to attend, they provide much needed cousin bonding time.

While you can form friends anywhere, forming friends in your community is easier.
Forming a close bond with cousins is even easier. Most of the values run within the family and the status is mostly the same except for some outliers.

## Importance of Community

Relationships are the single most deciding factor of happiness by large.
Staying close to the community that welcomes us and does not see us as alien is important. It is for this very reason we see clustering of immigrants in other cities and countries.
[Alone Experiences Do not matter](Living/Four-Thousand-Weeks.md#Alone%20Experiences)

[A good life](Bytes/Links-Repository.md#What%20Makes%20a%20Good%20Life) is one that is filled with loving relations.

## Kids

Encourage kids to attend family functions. Push them to be friends with other cousins. Arrange for sleepovers.
Send kids to schools nearby. Better yet move to a location of the kid's school.
A childhood spent with many classmates nearby is the best.

## Partner Preferences

Partner Preferences are important in all decisions in life. But in this it is particularly important. Our partner might be in a moral dilemma on denying us the opportunity to move vs staying closer to their loved ones. We might be in dilemma of them moving. Tread this carefully. One hand is the work & opportunity and on potential connections on the other.

In India, it is customary for the woman to move to man's place. If the man works in a different city and is far off from the woman's place, it cuts her off from meeting family members. Make it a point to push the partner to regularly meet her loved ones. This is important for happiness of the partner and as a result my own happiness.

## Case against Migrating abroad

I am lucky to be born in a city where there are abundant opportunities in tech for myself. Bengaluru, India. Potentially many opportunities for my partner too.

If it requires one to migrate to a far away city within India for opportunity, they might as well immigrate to a different country. Though i guess some countries are too far.

### Visa Issues

WE can argue that most people who go abroad somehow manage and work around these issues. But this takes mental bandwidth. [It is mind taxing](Improving-Thinking/Scarcity.md#**Poverty%20Taxes%20the%20Mind**). Our creativity is diminished. A part of our mind is consumed with Visa troubles.
Such a life is not lived freely. It is always better to move to a country with lesser visa troubles and if possible lesser taxes.

## Case towards Migrating abroad

### My Love of Software

Software is my calling. I absolutely love coding. Especially software used by end users. I get a kick when a user benefits from arcane lines of text written on a computer. The research is vastly better in the US for tech. The work in India is sub par compared to the US. This does not have to do anything about the country. Just the fact that the head quarters of the famous FAANG companies is in the US. They income there is vastly higher. There is little hope to reach the echelon of positions in India without moving abroad. We get higher leverage abroad which translates to higher rewards monetarily and professionally.

### Fear of Missing out

But I regularly see Instagram updates of people in the US living their best lives. For a moment i realise what i am missing out on. The opportunity, the travel, the quality of air and roads.

### Advancing Partner's Career

Prioritise partner's preferences. A life is happy if a partner is happy. This is a personal opinion. I am the happiest if the people around me are happy. I have personal ambitions. But i also have a strong confidence that i can make it happen at any place.

## Arguments against Fear of Missing out

We forget about the things we are not missing out on. Remembering the things we would miss out if were to do the things we thought we are missing on.
Everyone lives their best lives on Instagram. I am just drawn to experiences i see that feel like i am missing out.
For example i would see a person visiting a concert aboard as me missing out. I would not even notice i never visited any concerts when they happened in my country.

## Migrating to a Different Country

We meet our loved ones only 10-15 times. Make the most of it.
Parents in India and the kids in the US would mean they visit each other once a year because of visa and money issues.

I'd argue that while the life in the US is good or maybe even great, it is because of the benefits are tangible and the losses not so much.

For long, I have contemplated moving to the US. I am a single kid to my parents. I did not go to the US not for my parents' sake, but for my sake. I need them.

I have already stayed very close to them and thoughts of seeing them for a mere 15 times more in 15 years seems sad to me. I also do not want to miss the gatherings of my extended family.

Make it a point to forcibly visit family 2 times a year in the event of moving.

## What about the Drama?

Non-Nuclear families tend to have a lot of drama. I want to avoid this drama. There is a case of privacy too. IMO the best strategy is to stay in separate homes to stay sane on difficult days but not so far that away that we couldn't visit them if needed.
A 30 min commute is ideal.

## Should I Never Move Then?

Not moving for better opportunities definitely reduces the potential one can reach. But potential does not mean only work output. If that is the priority then definitely moving is the best option. We can travel around the world if we immigrate to a first world country. It has better education for kids.

We also are leaving the potential opportunity for the following

1. Being a good child to our parents
2. The opportunity for our parents to be good grand parents to our kids.
3. Fun family and fun gatherings
4. We cannot truly belong at a place we aren't born. Takes a lot of effort if at all possible in a few cases.

## What about the Regret of "If only I Had moved"?

[Regret](Living/Regret.md) of not doing things is stronger than the things we do.
My personal opinion is to move for a few years. This alleviates the regret.

But i most people acquiesce to the demands of the newer environment. Slowly they get lazy on maintaining connections. I see myself doing that too.

I have this regret too, especially when i see the Instagram photos of friends abroad. I suffer from FOMO. I might choose to move if my partner prefers it.

## Summary

1. Move only if partner agrees to it.
2. Potentially stay close to loved ones and possibly of both partners.
3. Encourage kids to get along with cousins.
4. Move to a different country but make sure to visit your roots often
5. Whether migrating or not, realise what you gaining and not just what we are missing out.
