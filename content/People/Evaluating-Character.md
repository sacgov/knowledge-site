# Evaluating Character

1. Choice of spouse
   Their closest lifelong partner, is more revealing than anything they say or do in public.

    This choice tells you about their own innermost longings, expectations, and needs. It tells you what they think of themselves, and what they think they deserve in life (or will settle for). It is, I believe, the clearest indicator of priorities and values you will ever find.

2. How they treat service workers
3. Experiences in formative years
    Peopleâ€™s character and ability to handle challenges are almost entirely formed during the first two decades of their life.
4. How they spend time and money.
5. Identify what irritates people the most in others
    The flaw people hate most in others is usually their own greatest weakness.
6. Can they listen? , they can choose to (1) talk, (2) listen, or (3) do neither. 2 > 1> 3.
7. If they cheat at small things, they will cheat at big things.
8. Watch how they handle unexpected problems.
9. A red flag is a red flag. Never ignore red flags.
