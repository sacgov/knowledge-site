# On Writing

## Writing Tips

**Clarity Above all** : Be a windowpane. It not great if we see it. We should see beneath it.

**Waste No Time** : Take extra time to make the readers spend less time. It is easier to write a longer document compared to a smaller one.

**Do not sound smart, be smart** : Complexity detracts from our goal. It hides our ideas from the view. We don't read complex things we decipher them. Do not use fancy words.

**Be the authority :** In my opinion, retail markets maybe better. This line wastes time for its readers. Do not use wishy washy word like should, could etc

**Formatting is important** : Creating an organised impression and having a clarity.

**Short paragraphs** are the key. Bullets are to be used strategically. Very short paragraphs do not need it.

**Use Bold sparingly** and it collects important information and makes document more skim able.

**Type Face** is very important. It sets the tone of the message.

**Scaffold well.** Build the page structure nicely. Great writers are great revisers.

**Practice**. Good writing is about practice.

**Short Sentences.** Don’t write a single sentence longer than two lines!”

## Writing for the Reader

### Business Memo

Write the First Paragraph with no Fluff and Get to the 3 Points. Elaborate the Three Points in Three Paragraphs. Conclusion is the First Paragraph Worded Differently

### Pitch Memo

Focuses on the benefits

### Informative Memo

Focuses on the information

## Improving Legibility

### Mangled Modifiers

But the modifiers near the object they are modifying.

Bad : working hard and paying attention, i saw my students make progress
Good : i saw the hard working and attention paying students make progress

Bad : The dog chased a squirrel up a tree that was chattering
Good : The dog chased the squirrel that was chattering a tree

### Serial Comma

Before i was starting to write, i answered email, called my sister (uncertainty here) and blew a whistle.

### Placing Pronouns

The pronoun has to be nearer to the antecedent. We should not use pronouns in topic sentences. Pronoun placement is confusing some times.

Examples:

1. I create campaigns for the clients and launch them. Launch the clients?
2. Steve ate, Harry slept. He went to a store later. He went to breakfast.
3. The dog sat quietly by the window with his bone as the cat waited to pounce. It was white. What exactly is "white" here?

### Apostrophe

It vs it's exception. It's → it is. ' for possession. Fashionista's hair blocked my view.

Fashionistas are all the rage today.
That vs which → that → no comma, which → a comma
House that is 3 door down → essential information.
House, which i did not like very much → non essential information

### Prepositions

I went to the client with business plan after work
I delivered the business plan to the clients after work
I delivered the client's business plan after work
