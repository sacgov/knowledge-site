# Communicating-well

Before we learn how to communicate, we need to remember that

> To be quiet is to listen, to listen is to change ones life.

## Tips

1. Think **thrice** before speaking. Listen without an intent to reply but to understand.
2. **Give** **empathy** and **not** **shift** the conversation
3. Make the other person feel great
4. People pay heed to only what they understand.
5. Do not whine, brag or sound needy.
6. Be vulnerable.
7. Conversation needs to interesting **only** to the other person. It is a bonus if we find it interesting too.
8. Sometimes people just want to talk and not want a deep conversation.
9. Look in the eye.
10. First impressions matter. It is difficult to change them later.
11. Asking for feedback creates a critic. Asking for advice creates a partner.
12. Just ask for the damn thing

## Non Violent Communication

Notes from the [Book, NVC](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication)

1. **Observing Instead Of Evaluating :**
	1. You’re always late!
	2. We agreed to leave the house at 9 am, but it’s 9.30 am now
	3. You’re not listening to me
	4. I can see that you are texting on your phone while I am speaking to you
2. **Stating Your Feelings**
	1. I can see that you are texting on your phone while I am speaking to you.**I feel overlooked**.
	2. We agreed to leave the house at 9 am, but it’s 9.30 am now.**I feel anxious**.
3. **Expressing Your Needs**
	1. We agreed to leave the house at 9 am, but it’s 9.30 am now. I feel anxious. It’s important to me to support my sister. So I want to arrive in time to help out.
	2. I can see that you are texting on your phone while I am speaking to you. I feel overlooked, and I need to share my experience with someone
4. **Making A Request**
	1. We agreed to leave the house at 9 am, but it’s 9.30 am now. I feel anxious. It’s important to me to support my sister, so I want to arrive in time to help out. Would you be willing to finish weeding the garden later on so we can leave as soon as possible?
	2. I can see that you are texting on your phone while I am speaking to you. I feel overlooked, and I need to share this with someone. Would you be willing to put your phone away for the next 10 minutes and hear what I have to say?

## Do not Be that Friend

1. The friend who hears the story and actually feels shame for you. She gasps and confirms how horrified you should be. Then there is awkward silence. Then you have to make her feel better.
2. The friend who responds with sympathy (I feel so sorry for you) rather than empathy (I get it, I feel with you, and I’ve been there). If you want to see a shame cyclone turn deadly, throw one of these at it: “Oh, you poor thing.” Or, the incredibly passive-aggressive southern version of sympathy: “Bless your heart.”
3. The friend who needs you to be the pillar of worthiness and authenticity. She can’t help because she’s too disappointed in your imperfections. You’ve let her down.
4. The friend who is so uncomfortable with vulnerability that she scolds you: “How did you let this happen? What were you thinking?” Or she looks for someone to blame: “Who was that guy? We’ll kick his ass.”
5. The friend who is all about making it better and, out of her own discomfort, refuses to acknowledge that you can actually be crazy and make terrible choices: “You’re exaggerating. It wasn’t that bad. You rock. You’re perfect. Everyone loves you.”
6. The friend who confuses “connection” with the opportunity to one-up you: “That’s nothing. Listen to what happened to me one time!”

## Being effective

### Active Listening

1. Give affirmation sounds when they are speaking like ah, ok
2. Do not fidget and divert the calls
3. Think about time, location
4. Listen to verbal and non-verbal communication
5. Summarise what i have heard in my own words

### Assertivenes

1. It is about being fair and reasonable not pushing your needs at the expense of others
2. Acknowledging opinions of others
3. I won’t instead of i can’t. I am responsible and i want to grow.
4. Make sure rights i claim for myself are also given to others

### Communicating Bad News

Be Brief, Specific and Factual

## Questioning

Open questions

1. How do you handle stressful situations
2. But this gets the people speaking a lot of blah blah and too much for their brain

Probing questions -Can you give an example when you last felt very angry

Closed question

1. A thorough understanding is required
2. Did the project succeed
3. Bridging & Repetition question.
4. Kind of probing but used to support conversation.

Hypothetical questions

Avoid asking multiple questions at once.

## The Pause

Practice the pause. Take a moment as if thinking deeply. Then reply after a minute.

## Authenticity

1. Don’t make people feel uncomfortable but be honest.
2. Don’t upset anyone or hurt anyone’s feelings but say what’s on your mind.
3. Sound informed and educated but not like a know-it-all.
4. Don’t say anything unpopular or controversial but have the courage to disagree with the crowd.Self compassionPerfectionism is not the same thing as striving to be your best. Perfectionism is not about healthy achievement and growth.

## Saying no

**Do not hem and Haw**: - Don't beat around the bush or offer weak excuses or hem and haw. This only provides an opening for the other person. Don't delay or stall either. Provide a brief explanation if you feel you need to; however, don't feel compelled

**Be assertive** -I appreciate your asking me for help, but I'm stretched too thin right now to devote the time to be of quality help to you

**Do not settle for a reduced amount** - I cannot come this sunday. Well can you come the coming sunday - bad

**Put the question back on the person asking**. -I am stretched thin. how can i prioritise to do certain things better

**Be selfish** - in saying no. This makes it better for the things you say yes to.

**Expressing your gratitude** - if you feel the need to

**Decisions factors**

1. If not hell yes, then no. I want only hell yes situations. This is what we have time for.
2. Will saying yes prevent me from focusing on something that’s more important?
3. Does this potential project, opportunity, or activity align with my values, and goals?
4. Will saying yes make me even more tired or burnt out?
5. Will saying yes be good for my mental health? Or will it worsen my symptoms?
6. In the past, when have I said yes and then ended up regretting it?
