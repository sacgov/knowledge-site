    Tell me more

2. Use nonverbal acknowledgment that you listen
    Nodding mmmmm / uhuh

3. Ask follow-up questions to keep people talking?

    How did that make you feel?
    And then what?
    What were you thinking when that happened?

4. Paraphrase what people said to show you listened

## Ending a Conversation

1. If someone doesn’t want to talk, don’t force the conversation.
2. You’ll get short closed answers.
3. Someone doesn’t look at you.
4. They start/keep doing something else.
5. If conversations seem to be going nowhere.
6. Or if there seems to be no real interest feel free to leave

Example
(Excuse me) I have to go …
It was nice talking to you, but I have to
Alright, see you around

If a conversation doesn’t flow or just ends, let it go
Don’t take this personally.

There are numerous reasons beyond your influence why it doesn’t work.
