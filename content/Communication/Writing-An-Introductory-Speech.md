# Writing an Introductory Speech

Help the audience to engage with you while establishing trustworthiness.

- Inspires meaning and action
- Builds relevance and establishes credibility
- Tells a human story

Introduction

To write a strong introduction, think of the topic's relevance for your audiences and immediately tell them the value or benefits they can get after hearing your speech.

The introduction i prepared while joining my job in Sep 2022.

I am Sachin. I graduated in 2017. I live with my parents in Hyderabad but i am originally from Mysore. I speak 5 languages as a result. I have always been fascinated with internet since 2005 when we got a dial up connection of 128 Kbps. To work in a SaaS was dream come true.

Meet some incredible people in my last 5 years of working. I was mentored, helped and trusted. It was bumpy ride from 4 employees to 1400. It was enjoyable and more importantly memorable. I look forward to learning from awesome people here at Nirvana, share mine too in my time here.

New beginnings are exciting and also a bit scary. After meeting you guys, I am less anxious and more excited.

It is not very often that we get such an opportunity. To be trusted with being a member of a small team is privilege. Thanks X for reaching out. I feel lucky.

I love reading, especially economics, psychology and philosophy in non-fiction and classics in fiction. I am learning nutrition and fitness related sciences lately. I lost about 26 kgs of weight in the last year. Picked up Half and Full Marathon running. The pandemic has been tough on everyone. I picked up meditation and mindfulness.

Looking forward to connecting with you all. Thanks for a warm and endearing welcome.
