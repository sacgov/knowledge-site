# Neuro-associative Conditioning

Neuro-associative conditioning is a powerful set of techniques you can use to take control of your life.

Notes from the [post](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/personal-growth/neuro-associative-conditioning/)

1. Decide what you want and what is preventing you from having it now.
2. Get leverage: associating massive pain of not changing now and pleasure to changing Ask pain inducing questions. Leverage is the burning pain in adhering to one's standards.
3. Interrupt limiting patterns: Cartoon of why I'm feeling bad now. Reframe the story
4. Create a new empowering alternative: Cartoon of yourself where you want to be.
5. Condition this pattern until consistent: fixed schedule of reinforcement.
6. Test it: Enough pain to stop the pattern relapsing. Enough pleasure to keep it moving.
