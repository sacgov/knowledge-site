# Daring Greatly

Notes from the book [Daring Greatly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly)

## Engaging with Vulnerability

Our willingness to own and engage with our vulnerability determines the depth of our courage and the clarity of our purpose; the level to which we protect ourselves from being vulnerable is a measure of our fear and disconnection. When we spend our lives waiting until we’re perfect or bulletproof before we walk into the arena, we ultimately sacrifice relationships and opportunities that may not be recoverable, we squander our precious time, and we turn our backs on our gifts, those unique contributions that only we can make

## Wholehearted Living

**Authenticity**: Letting Go of What People Think
**Self-Compassion**: Letting Go of Perfectionism
**Resilient Spirit**: Letting Go of Numbing and Powerlessness
**Gratitude and Joy**: Letting Go of Scarcity and Fear of the Dark
**Intuition and Trusting Faith**: Letting Go of the Need for Certainty
**Play and Rest**: Letting Go of Exhaustion as a Status Symbol
**Calm and Stillness**: Letting Go of Anxiety as a Lifestyle
**Meaningful Work**: Letting Go of Self-Doubt and Supposed To's.
**Laughter, Song, and Dance**: Letting Go of Being Cool and Always in Control

## Connection

Connection is why we are here. This is what matters in life. If there is something that is shameful and then i am not worthy of connection. I am not good enough

I have the feeling of i am not fun enough.
In order for a connection to happen, a sense of worthiness is required.

Have the courage to be imperfect. We cannot practice compassion to others if we are not compassionate towards ourselves.

We have to fully embraced vulnerability. What makes us vulnerable makes us beautiful. It is neither comfortable nor excruciating.
It was the willingness to say i love you first.
**Doing something where there are not guarantees.**
Willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out.

## Fear of Being Ordinary

Shame-based fear of being ordinary.
.
I see the fear of never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to be lovable, to belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose.

What are the messages and expectations that define our culture and how does culture influence our behaviours? How are our struggles and behaviours related to protecting ourselves? How are our behaviours, thoughts, and emotions related to vulnerability and the need for a strong sense of worthiness?

What makes this constant assessing and comparing so self-defeating is that we are often comparing our lives, our marriages, our families, and our communities to unattainable, media-driven visions of perfection, or we’re holding up our reality against our own fictional account of how great someone else has it.

## What Does Being Vulnerable Look Like?

Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness.

It feels so awkward and scary, but it makes me human and alive.

Vulnerability is like being naked onstage and hoping for applause rather than laughter. It’s being naked when everyone else is fully clothed. It feels like the naked dream:

Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them. Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-building process.

Because they can’t articulate how they feel about our disengagement when we stop making an effort with them, they show us by acting out, thinking, This will get their attention.

We simply can’t learn to be more vulnerable and courageous on our own. Sometimes our first and greatest dare is asking for support.

We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honour the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness, and affection. Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them—we can only love others as much as we love ourselves. Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed

## Perfectionism

In all of my data collecting, I’ve never heard one person attribute their joy, success, or Wholeheartedness to being perfect.

Perfectionism is not the same thing as striving for excellence. Perfectionism is not about healthy achievement and growth. Perfectionism is a defensive move. It’s the belief that if we do things perfectly and look perfect, we can minimise or avoid the pain of blame, judgment, and shame.

**Perfectionism is not self-improvement.**
Perfectionism is, at its core, about trying to earn approval. Most perfectionists grew up being praised for achievement and performance (grades, manners, rule following, people pleasing, appearance, sports). Somewhere along the way, they adopted this dangerous and debilitating belief system: I am what I accomplish and how well I accomplish it. Please. Perform. Perfect.

**Perfectionism is not the key to success.**
In fact, research shows that perfectionism hampers achievement. Perfectionism is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis or missed opportunities.
