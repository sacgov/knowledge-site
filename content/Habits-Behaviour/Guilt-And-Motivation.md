# Guilt and Motivation

This is summary of a collection of articles that appear on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pFatcKW3JJhTSxqAF).

# Goal

Remove guilt-based motivation entirely, and replace it with intrinsic motivation. I'm aiming to both reduce the frequency of Netflix binges and reduce the bad feelings that follow.

**Once we learn our lessons from the past, there is no reason to wreck ourselves with guilt**.

All we need to do, in any given moment, is look upon the actions available to us, consider, and take whichever one seems most likely to lead to a future full of light.

When all is said and done, Nature will not judge us by our actions; we will be measured only by what actually happens.

# The Two Types of People

**Slackers**: Reject the implication that quality=preferences. Who complain constantly about the useless pointless work they have to do, who half-ass the assignment and turn in something that either barely passes or fails entirely. Slackers tend to resent the authority forcing them to write the paper.

**Tryers**: are the ones who accept the premise that quality=preferences. Tryers include people of all ability levels: some struggle as hard as they can just to get a C, others flaunt their ability to produce masterpieces. Others are perfectionists who simply can't allow themselves to turn in anything less than their best effort. Some of them are scrupulous people, who feel guilty even after getting an A, because they know they could have done better, and think they should have. Some are humble, some are show-offs, but all of them are pushing rightward.

Society conditions us to think of the tryers as better than the slackers.

Example

What is your goal in taking this class? Perhaps a combination of social pressure (your parents said to), social inertia (everybody else goes to college), and a vague belief that this is the path towards a good job and a comfortable life. Or because you want good grades so you can acquire lots of money and power. Or a genuine thirst for knowledge. But no matter why you're there, your reason for being there will pick out a single target point on the quality line. Your goal, then, is to hit that quality target — no higher, no lower.

If you're trying to pass the class, then pass it with minimum effort.
If you're trying to ace the class, then ace it with minimum effort.

If you're trying to learn the material to the fullest, then mine the assignment for all its knowledge, and don't fret about your grade. Anything else is wasted motion.

One needs to be clear of his end goals.

# Path of Minimum Resistance

If you want to be highly effective, remember what you're fighting for, your end goals.

If you're trying to do achieve some combination of good grades (for signalling purposes), respect (for social reasons), and knowledge (for various effects), then pinpoint the minimum quality target that gets a good grade, impresses the teacher, and allows you to learn the material, and hit that as efficiently as you can. Anything more is wasted motion.

Both the slackers and the tryers are pursuing lost purposes. The slackers scoff at the tryers, who treat an artificial quality line like it's their actual preferences and waste effort over-achieving. The tryers scoff at the slackers, who are taking classes but refusing to learn. And both sides are right! Because both sides are wasting motion.

The slackers fail to deploy their full strength because they realize that the quality line is not their preference curve. The tryers deploy their full strength at the wrong target, in attempts to go as far right as possible, wasting energy on a fight that is not theirs. So take the third path: remember what you're fighting for. Always deploy your full strength, in order to hit your quality target as fast as possible.

# Importance of Tasks

Some things are too important to half ass.

Think like saving a life from fire.

That said, the quality target can be really really high. In fact, the quality target is sometimes unattainably high. Often, we simply aren't capable of hitting our quality targets, and in those cases, we do want to push as far right along the preference curve as we can.

This can occur naturally whenever you work on something difficult relative to your skill level, or in competitive situations, or if you're signalling your ability to work hard. But don't get confused. Even if you write for the love of writing, you eventually have to stop editing and call it finished. Even if you're getting somebody out of a burning building, you eventually stop putting effort towards ensuring that they survive in favour of putting that effort towards saving other dying people instead.

Some tasks are too meaningless.

But what if "get the minimum passing grade as quick as possible" is also boring

Get out of college. Simple do not them

![ https://mindingourway.com/content/images/2015/Mar/Quality2.png ](%20https://mindingourway.com/content/images/2015/Mar/Quality2.png%20)

I'm compelled to do my best.

**Instead of being a perfectionist about the paper, be a perfectionist about writing the paper. Be a perfectionist about identifying good strategies**

# Reject Dichotomy

We either do as little as we can get away with or as much as we can manage. We're either aiming for barely acceptable or we're aiming to be the best. Very few people seem able to pick a target in the middle and then pursue it with everything they've got.

**Few people seem capable of deploying their full strength to hit "mediocre" as efficiently as possible.**

Succeed, with no wasted motion.

The slacker in you rebels against pointless tasks, and the tryer in you wants perfection. So satisfy both: aim for the minimum necessary target, and move there as efficiently as possible.

# Failing with Abandon

Say you're trying to eat no more than 2000 calories per day, and then eat 2300 by the end of dinner, you don't have to say “well I already missed my target, so I might as well indulge.”

Over and over, I see people set themselves a target, miss it by a little, and then throw all restraint to the wind. "Well," they seem to think, "willpower has failed me; I might as well over-indulge." I call this pattern "failing with abandon."

Do not do this. Period.

## Is Guilt a Form of Comparison?

Regret and guilt are emotions that are based on a form of comparison. So regret, I'm comparing what really happened to some imagined alternative. And some of the time, that's all we feel, right? I just imagine that something could have been better. Guilt involves an additional comparison to what has been called our personal standards, rules and goals. So what are the things that we aspire to, in our behavior? And when we make a comparison that says what we really did falls short of those personal standards, rules or goals for ourselves, then we're likely to feel guilt.

# Listless Guilt

Attempts to silence the voice that whispers that there must be something else to life.

Start exploring that feeling that there must be something more to do — and either find something worth working towards, or find that there really isn't actually anything missing. This first sort of listless guilt, I think, comes from someone who wants to find something else to do, and hasn't yet.

If something seems like it's missing in life, if it seems like there's something else you should be doing with your time, then probe the feeling. Figure out what's missing.

The listless guilt is a guilt about not doing anything. To remove it, we must first turn it into a guilt about not doing something in particular.

# Pointed Guilt

They stem from neglected obligations. The subject thinks there's something they should be doing (or some way they should be), and they're not doing it (or aren't being it), and so they feel really guilty.

I claim that the word "should" is causing damage here.

Don't say "I really should finish this paper." Say "if I don't finish this paper, I'll get a worse grade than I was planning to, and my teacher will frown at me, and my parents will frown at me." Then weigh your options. Then choose.

**You can pull harder if you're pulling because you want to, not just because you should.**

# Working Incessantly

Working yourself ragged is not a virtue. You don't get extra points for effort. In fact, you lose points for effort: effort is costly; spend it only to purchase better outcomes.

The goal is not to finish all the work before you; for that is impossible. The goal is simply to move through the work.

Advertisements and media often push the narrative that the purpose of all our toil is to win a chance at relaxation. We've to work hard at boring jobs to earn our vacations. Work hard for decades so we can retire.

Inaction is boring. We pick up books, go exploring, and take up hobbies. Ground state is an active state, not passive.

# Rest

Rest is not a reward for getting through all your obligations. Rest isn't something you do when everything else is finished. Everything else doesn't get finished. That's finite task thinking. Rather, rest and health are just two of the unending streams that you move through

# Tools for Shifting Guilt

## Refinement

Ask the guilt what, precisely, it would have you do instead of what you did. Do not settle for "I should have been studying." Demand a specific action: Which book? Which chapter?

You will remember that none of the alternatives were compelling. Maybe the party was for an old friend. Guilt disappears

After refining guilt, you find yourself left with an obligation ("I should have drank less" or "I should have studied"
This has not yet shifted enough to be confronted. For obligations, you need the second tool.

## Internalisation

You say you "should have" studied more, instead of going to the party? Says who? Cash out the should.

What would happen if you decide to never study that textbook again? Is it a relief? If so, then drop the obligation, and relinquish the guilt. You probably just accidentally confused someone's quality line with your preference curve.
Don't settle for an externalised answer (such as "because then people wouldn't like me"); push on until you get an internalised answer ("because I prefer worlds where ______").

Internalisation shifts guilt: it forces the guilt to either resolve itself, or reveal itself to you in terms of your own desires. It shifts the guilt to a place where the thing the guilt demands are things you want for yourself, rather than things you want because you think you should.

## Realism

Look at your guilt, and ask it whether its demands are realistic. Remember that working yourself ragged is not a virtue

If you find yourself regularly experiencing guilt, then you're using guilt incorrectly.
Guilt-motivated people tend to operate by working fervently in attempts to avoid the scourge of guilt.
Guilt is very costly, if it's getting activated regularly, it is on the wrong branches of possibility.

## Experiment and Learning

If you want to figure out how to avoid a certain recurring situation, then there's a different tool that is appropriate, that's much more effective at figuring out how to steer the future towards better places: Science!

Treat it like an experiment! Write up your hypotheses. Experiment with many different ways to fix your glitches. Write postmortems when you fail. If you attempt a fix and then find yourself binging again, then don't heap loads of guilt on yourself! That still doesn't help. Instead, say "Aha! So that attempted fix didn't work. I wonder if I can figure out why?" Cross a hypothesis or two off your list. Refine your models. Expand your hypothesis. Gather more data.

Guilt aides in learning. But if it happens again and again it’s a sign we ain’t learning.

# Turn over a New Leaf

Let us call the new version v 2.0.
It's often easy for the new v 2.0 of us to recognise lingering guilt as a bodily response marking malcontent about something that was done in the past, by the v 1.0. The best action for the v 2.0 to take, usually, is to check what regretted action caused the guilt, check what pattern of behaviour led to the regretted action, mark down a note about which cognitive pattern needs to be reprogrammed, and then dismiss the guilt (which has now served its purpose).

With practice, it is possible to reflexively treat the initial gut-wrenching guilt as an instruction to update your behavioural patterns, and then dismiss the lingering guilt immediately.

Notice the guilt, listen to the message it bears, and actually write down the behavioral pattern that you wish to change. Then spend five minutes (a full five minutes, by the clock) brainstorming ways that you might change the pattern and start retraining your mind. Then thank the guilt for carrying you this message, and dismiss it.

# Not Standing up to the Ideals - Broken Could's

People berate themselves whenever their brain fails to be inline with the cognitive patterns that they wish it was, as if they had complete dominion over their own thoughts, over the patterns laid down in their heads. As if they weren't a network of neurons. As if they could choose their preferred choice in spite of their cognitive patterns, rather than recognising that choice is a cognitive pattern.

Almost everybody is a total mess internally, as best as I can tell. Almost everybody struggles to act as they wish to act.

The things we're trying to do are hard. When the monkey runs into an obstacle and falls, help it to its feet. Help it practice, train, or execute the next clever plan on your list of ways to overcome the obstacles before you.

Most people don't think they "could" cure world hunger by snapping their fingers, and so they don't feel terrible about failing to do this.

By contrast, people who fail to resist overeating, or who fail to stop playing Civilization at a reasonable hour, feel strongly that they "could have" resisted, and take this as a license to feel terrible about their decisions.

Most people have broken "coulds".

I suggest you stop berating yourself for failing to complete impossible tasks, and start experimenting and identifying which action nodes work.

# Self Compassion for the past

Steering the future is a difficult thing. Let the monkey know that you have its back.

In the past, you have failed to act as you wished to act. You have failed to make the best available choices. But these facts have little bearing on what you do next. Your memories still hold lessons that can teach you about how to better steer yourself to steer the world, but they do not say anything about the color of your soul. They are simply the background knowledge against which you move forwards, from here, looking only towards the future.


# Rising up to the Challenge

Rising to the challenge doesn't mean never feeling helpless. It means pushing on anyway, even if you feel helpless sometimes.

In my experience, tapping into internal drive often requires tapping into a deep desire to make the world be different, in a world that's very large and very hurting and very hard to change.

# Tolerating the Real World

They cannot see a world that is unacceptable. Upon noticing that the world is broken, they reflexively list reasons why it is still tolerable.

Accepting the world as it is can be really really hard. Saying "It seems I am not yet skilled enough to get a job in this field" can be tough, especially when your livelihood depends upon the opposite being true (and doubly so if you think that past failures make you a "bad person").

Take up the burden that is supposed to be unbearable. Don't excuse the world, don't come up with reasons why it's OK. Let it be not OK.

# Bad Vs Worse - Suffering

So frustration in the face of a choice between bad and worse may be a useful response. When you're offered the choice between bad and worse, the first thing to do is look for a third option and the second thing to do is ask for help. Find shortcuts. Try to cheat. Call in the cavalry, if you can.

But once you determine that there is no shortcut.
Then it is useful to be able to choose "bad," without suffering over it.

Next time you find yourself feeling flustered because none of your options pass an absolute acceptability threshold, pause and reframe, and look at the relative acceptability of your actions instead.

Take it, without suffering, no matter how bad it is. That is all there is to do.

**Treat it not as bad news about how reality went, but rather treat it as you would treat information about where in the multiverse you ended up.**

# Excuses & Owning Failures

Excuses are a license to fail.
Owning the failure and the future.

Excuses rob you of your agency. They perceive you as putting too much pressure on yourself. But that pressure is precisely the impetus to learn and adapt, and if you can bear it, then I suggest you do.

You don't need to win every time — but you do need to learn every time.
When trying to understand your failures, it's important to figure out what you could have done better, rather than generating a list of reasons you never could have won. If there were unforeseen circumstances, understand why you couldn't foresee them.

# Play to Win

To succeed, stop generating reasons why you never could have won, and play to win.

Assume the worst and be ready for it.
Come to terms with what could happen. Imagine the worst case, in detail; learn to weigh it on your scales; accept that if you fail things could go very poorly; and then maybe those bad outcomes will loosen their grip on you.

Visualise it in full detail. Don't need to excuse it. Don't tell yourself it wouldn't be your fault. Don't tell yourself it would be fine. Don't make up a story about how you'd handle it successfully. Just imagine the worst. [Stoicism](Living/Stoicism.md) advocates this too.

So don't get paralysed looking for the right thing to do. Just find the best action you can find,

If you begin to despair, then let that feeling be a reminder of what could be, and let everything that this world isn't be your fuel. Remember that despair started only when i realised what my world could be

# Desperation towards a Goal

By "desperation towards a goal" I mean the possession of a goal so important to you that you can commit yourself to it fully, without hesitation, without some part of you wondering whether it's really worth all your effort. I mean a goal that you pursue with both reckless abandon and cautious deliberation in fair portions. I mean a goal so important that it does not occur to you to spare time wondering whether you can achieve it, but only whether this path to achieving it is better or worse than that path.

Allowing yourself to become desperate in principle. It's allowing there to be at least one imaginary scenario where you'd let yourself commit fully to a task without hesitation

# Recklessness

Recklessness-the-virtue is about being in that state and deciding to push forward rather than retreating; deciding to make a desperate effort to acquire a new drive, rather than panicking and retreating back towards guilt.

Recklessness is in the ability to say "screw the odds, I'm going to push forward on this path as hard as I can until a better path appears

My advice, if you want to be effective, is always be solving the problem. With each motion, be overcoming an obstacle that stands between you and the goal. If the obstacles are too large, then your next task is to get stronger, get smarter, or find a way around. That is what it means, to find a path to the goal.

To achieve a goal, simply keep moving along that path.
A problem isn't solved until it's solved automatically, without need for attention or willpower.
