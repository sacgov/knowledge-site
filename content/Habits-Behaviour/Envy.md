# Envy

Envy is a tool for social comparison. Inequality is everywhere - more intelligent, more attractive socially or sexually. Such Differences matter a lot. They are not lost on the members of the tribe.

This combination - the reality of inequalities and the fact that we're hardwired to notice them - this is the fuel for our endless capacity for envy. We make sense of the world through social comparisons

Social media leads to more social comparisons They look at friends having dinner vs their own sad bowl of microwaved ramen noodles. Friends are honeymooning vs their own lonely lives.

Sometimes seeing that others are doing things that you can't do or that others have what you don't have doesn't merely produce feelings of envy. It produces anger, resentment.

We refuse to do a task if we see someone else getting more reward for the same as it reduces our place in the social hierarchy. Envy serves a major function in our improvement. So an important fact to notice is that whatever we envy our mind actually believes it as something we can achieve. We do no envy bill gates, but only our co-worker earning more than us.

Mozart had fun with girls, played around. Salieri was chaste and hard working. It was not possible for him to accept that such a vagabond could write such good music. Inequalities are the reality. He slowly caused Mozart to die penniless. He was the second best composer at that time but that did not matter anymore

Humans have evolved to resent those who outperform us. So outperform but not at rate that people resent us. Never boast about yourself such that others feel bad. There are not words for feeling happy for someone's success in any language, So it must not be natural to feel happy at someone's success.

We can quickly get out of friendship from folks who think they are better off without our competition. Or They may be friends for all purposes but not help us become better. So never tell anyone what we did well or actually do ascribe the success to someone else than ourselves or to luck.
