# Act - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy

This article is my understanding from the book - [Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25348.Get_Out_of_Your_Mind_and_Into_Your_Life)

In a nutshell: To find happiness, we try to avoid or get rid of bad feelings—but the harder we try, the more bad feelings we create.

## Illusion of Control

‘Get over it!’‘Shit happens!’‘Move on!’‘Chill out!’. Intrusive thoughts are not in our control.
Feel bad, then feel bad for feeling bad, feel further bad that it is only you that feels bad.

## What ’s Your Problem?

Fortunately i personally have not felt that darkness that many have felt. I have partly my very supportive family to thank for it.

Feelings of inadequacy - rejected at a job, by a potential crush. Not matching up with the [Social Media](Mental-Wellness/Chatter.md#Effect%20of%20Social%20Media) lives of others.

Take an example of a vicious cycle. I feel and over-weight -> I feel pressure and choose a [Distraction](Mental-Wellness/Chatter.md#Distraction%20) -> I eat junk food -> Weight increases -> I feel even more worthless -> I eat more junk food -> the cycle continues.

## Control Strategies - Flight

Escape/Run away - Read books, eat chocolate, go shopping. Numbing - Staying in the sheets.

## Control Strategies - Fight Suppression

Push feelings deep inside arguing rationally - I'm no failure. I am a good son. I am a product of so and so circumstances. I have a nice job. I am nice guy etc. Taking Charge - Snap out of it - Try to rein in the mind

Control strategies are great if done in a one-off occasional manner. You can scratch an itch but not a festering eczema.

## Making Friends with Pain

This is the basis of all buddhist teachings towards understanding _samsara_.
Read more [on making friends with pain](Mental-Wellness/Acceptance.md#Making%20Friends%20with%20Our%20Issues%20).
Build the willingness to not run from the pain. We feel silly when our control system do not work in the long run They might be actually detrimental in the long run

Action - List items i do to run away from stress. It can take the form of blaming others, reading self-help books, eating comfort foods (read junk food), walking/ exercising, social media or journalling.

Always make sure to be mindful of the task. We should not do something to take our mind of something else. There would be times when we would fail at this. We can become emotionally resilient fighting our demons.

1. Did any of the above distractions get rid of painful thoughts in long run?
2. What did it cost me in time, energy, money and vitality?
3. Did it bring me any closer to my goal of actually being happy?

For Me personally the answers to the above questions is no.
It’s hard to appreciate life when you’re running away from something threatening.

## Mindless Activities Are less Satisfying

Recall the last time you ate something rich and tasty to try to stop feeling stressed, or bored, or unhappy. Chances are, it wasn’t all that satisfying. However, did you ever eat that very same food, not to get rid of bad feelings, but purely and simply to enjoy it and appreciate its taste? I bet you found that much more fulfilling.

## Reframing

Reframing lessens influence.
Premeditate evils. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_visualization)
[Acceptance](Mental-Wellness/Acceptance.md) - Make room for the pain Mindfulness - Contact With The Present Moment. Instead of dwelling on the past, or worrying about the future.
Observing self - Taking a third person view. Action - Fixing the issues at hand with a direction in mind. [](Mental-Wellness/Chatter.md#Temporal%20Distancing)

## Storytelling

Stories help humans make sense of the world. Humans rely heavily on words. Words shape thoughts. Most of our thoughts are neither true nor false. Most of them are either stories about how we see life.

In a state of cognitive fusion. The following errors occur

1. Thoughts are reality — As if what we’re thinking were actually happening.
2. Thoughts are important — We give them our full attention.
3. Thoughts are orders — we automatically obey them

Action - Replace sentences with i am having a thought rather than believe it

### Is My Thought Helpful?

Whether a thought is true is not important. Far more important is whether it’s helpful.

Questions on thoughts

1. Is this thought in any way useful or helpful?
2. Is this a recurring thought?
3. Does it need to be repeated?
4. Does this thought disparage me?
5. Does it help me take action to create the life I want?
6. Is this thought helpful for the long run?

Things that did not personally help me but might help others.

1. Positive affirmations. I am a cynic and do not believe unless i see evidence.
2. Arguing that problems are a part of common humanity. While one might find solace thinking that they are not alone, personally for me it does not matter. I am only concerned at making the situation at hand better.

## Acceptance

Acceptance does not mean ‘putting up with’ or resigning yourself to anything. Acceptance is about embracing life, not merely tolerating it. Acceptance literally means ‘taking what is offered’. Acceptance is like finding that firm foothold. It’s a realistic appraisal of where your feet are and what condition the ground is in. It doesn’t mean that you like being in that spot, or that you intend to stay there. Once you have a firm foothold, you can take the next step more effectively. The more fully you accept the reality of your situation—as it is, here and now—the more effectively you can take action to change it.

If your life isn’t working for you, the only sensible thing is to take action to change it. That action will be far more effective when you start from a place of acceptance. Acceptance frees up your energy for life-enhancing activities.

### Steps

1. See what you do with a thought.
2. Notice the different ways in which you struggle.
3. Do you challenge your thoughts, trying to disprove or invalidate them?
4. Do you judge them as good or bad, true or false, positive or negative?
5. Do you try to push them away or replace them with ‘better’ ones?
6. Do you enter into a debate with your mind?

Observe your struggle with interest and notice what it accomplishes.

If thoughts are coming back it is okay. But it causing pain recurrently would mean that we have not accepted the reality.

**Mindfulness & Distancing** - Take 10 deep breaths. Observe from a distance.

## Chatter

Intrusive thoughts are trying to protect us from previous errors. But they are not very useful in a modern context. Allow painful emotions to reside alongside you. Make friends with them. Read more on [Chatter](Mental-Wellness/Chatter.md)

Steps

1. How would I act differently if painful thoughts and feelings were no longer an obstacle?
2. What projects or activities would I start (or continue) if my time and energy weren’t consumed by troublesome emotions?
3. What would I do if fear were no longer an issue?
4. What would I attempt if thoughts of failure didn’t deter me?

## Understanding Emotions

Emotions are predictions. Emotions are reactions. Thoughts are not in our control to an extent. But emotions are. Emotion is basically motion to a thought.

If we consciously bring our awareness to how we are feeling, and consciously observe how we’re behaving, then no matter how intense our emotions are, we can still control our actions.

### Types of Discomfort

**Clean discomfort** - Actual discomfort that no one can avoid
**Dirty Discomfort** - Discomfort trying to avoiding discomfort

Courage is grace under pressure.

### Urge Surfing

It is important to understand that emotions are learned behaviours. They are predicted by a brain that penalised non dopamine and boosts actions that increase dopamine. Your emotional reaction in a given situation has been shaped by literally millions of learning experiences throughout your life. A dense neural network

**Noticing urge**
Urges are like waves. Cannot be resisted only surfed.

Steps

1. Observe where in your body you feel the urge most strongly.
2. Score the urge on a scale of 1 to 10.
3. Acknowledge, ‘I’m having the urge to …’. Watch it ebb and flow Don’t try to suppress it or get rid of it.
4. Breathe into it; make room for it.

Never do anything mindlessly. Neither eating nor watching television.

### Boredom

Boredom is basically a thought process: a story that life would be more interesting and more fulfilling if we were doing something else. The thinking self is easily bored because it thinks it already knows it all.

### An Example on Useful Thoughts

[Link to Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/F2hc2FLOdhI?t=250)
When Guy Winch turned 26, He was living away from his family. Most of friends have settled in the US away from their family. Loneliness is pervasive. Winch had a twin brother who would call him on every birthday and vice-versa. They were twins. But this time Guy who was away from family was lonely. He fed himself a thought that his brother and his family did not care about him anymore. It was a long night for him.
The next day he realised he had disconnected the phone the other night, anxiously pacing along the room letting his chatter get the better of him.
As soon as he connects the phone, the phone rings and his brother asks why had guy not called him back if he was angry that his brother had not called him.

Take a moment to recollect examples of thoughts that you have put in your mind that have no use but to cause misery.

An example thought of mine.

A Friend X did not include me in his plan. He does not think of me as a friend. So i do not include him in my plans. X might feel the same about me.

A better strategy is to always think of a positive reason (reframing our thought) and include X giving them a benefit of doubt. A few instances later you can be clear on what is the truth.

An example where it is better to ignore a truth but harmful thought.
I am not well prepared for the exam. I will fail anyways. Now that i am failing, is it even worth studying on the last date. Is it even worth attending.

I am not well prepared is a truth. But this thought is not helping. We can reframe it is, lets do the best we can as of today. We can think of studying better after the exam.

### Understanding Despair

You tend to get hooked by stories from the past: about all the things that actually have gone wrong and how badly they’ve affected you. The thinking self then uses that history to convince you that the future is going to be just more of the same. These stories are very compelling and we’re all too ready to give them our full attention.

### Last of Human Freedoms

In the movie Schindler's List, there were men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances; to choose one’s own way.

## What Do You Really Want?

Deep down inside, what do you really want? Usually when I ask people this question, people reply with superficial answers like: I just want to be happy and rich. I want to be successful at something. - Status I want someone to love me. I just want to get married and have kids.

Why can’t I just be happy like everyone around me? They don’t suffer the way I suffer. Why can’t I be like them? They do. Everyone suffers and has pain.

### Pain and Suffering

> Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

Pain plus unwillingness to feel that pain equals suffering.
The pain we feel is a focus of attention because it seems to interfere with other activities. One way to get at this core issue is to imagine how your life would be different if your pain went away.

**Pain of presence** - (issues that are present that you would prefer to go away)
**Pain of absence** - Activities you would engage in if matters changed

**Experiential avoidance** is the process of trying to avoid your own experiences (thoughts, feelings, memories, bodily sensations, behavioural predispositions) even when doing so causes long-term behavioural difficulties (like not going to a party because you’re a social phobic, or not exercising because you feel too depressed to get out of bed).

Experiential avoidance tends to artificially amplify the “pain of presence”, and it is the single biggest source of the “pain of absence,” since it is avoidance that most undermines positive actions.

You try to avoid the experience of painful thoughts or feelings by burying yourself in distracting activities, combating your thoughts with rationalisations, or trying to quash your feelings through the use of controlled substances.
If you are suffering, you may spend a lot of time performing these distracting coping techniques. Meanwhile, your life is not being lived.

Sometimes not trying to solve the problem but just living according to values is better. At least the pain of absence is lessened. We will actually notice that it solves for pain for presence too.

ACT believes that any efforts to attain ground or cope are useless in long term.
ACT suggests writing these down for 2 weeks.

### Moving on

We do not need to change anything. We just have to be more mindful of what we are doing.
In order to live a healthy, vital, meaningful, and satisfying life you needed to give up trying to control your internal thoughts and feelings before you could move in the direction you want to go. If that was what was required, to what degree would you be willing to do that?

**Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?**

You can classify them into evaluations (judgments you make about things); predictions (attempts to forecast the future); post-dictions (attempts to understand or sort through the past; this may occur if you are engaged in “what if-ing” past experiences); or self-conceptualisations (judgments made about yourself; these often come in the form of “I am” statements)

**Watch your thoughts.**
I think, therefore I am. We make our thoughts and then they make us.
