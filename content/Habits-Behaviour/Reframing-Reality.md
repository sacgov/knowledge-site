# Reframing Reality

Some are downers. See the negative in all situations. What we can do with our minds, what we can do with our intention and our energy is incredible and it's a power that we often fail to realise is even there.

Is it ever enough? Will I ever do enough? Is any amount of training ever enough Every day is a struggle as we are not where we want to be The fact that i am stressed itself is a pointer for stress

Would climbing Everest be such a great feat if it was just a walk in the park? It's just a cold, dark night on the side of Everest This is it. This is what makes you great, what makes you succeed. Stress is the experience or anticipation of adversity in one's goal-related efforts

We view mindsets as core assumptions that we make about the nature of ourselves or things in the world. They're beliefs, really. We have mindsets about our own abilities or our intelligence, but we also have mindsets about other things. Mindsets about the nature of stress, mindsets about the capabilities or limitations of our own bodies, mindsets about the enoughness of the foods that we're eating or the exercise we're doing. They're perspectives, they're lenses or frameworks, they're just assumptions about the meaning or the nature of those things.

Many of us don't understand the power of mindsets. We don't even realise we have mindsets.

So often we think that our beliefs, our experiences are a direct reflection of the world as it objectively is. But we see them through our mindsets. Our perceptions, our beliefs, our experiences are always an interpretation.

Our mindset of our diet matters more than diet itself in some cases. Okay, are you going to be able to do this? How is this milkshake or meal going to make you feel? Are you getting enough exercise?"

Oh, well, if I'm not getting enough food, I need to maybe slow my metabolism down. Be careful of the stories your are telling yourself apart from the actual truth

It's not that one mindset is right or wrong. Just what helps us currently It may be helpful to think of mindsets as a frame that we put around reality. Different frames highlight different aspects of the picture

Adolescents who believe that stress can be enhancing actually don't have that negative impact on self-control.

If you do remove all stress, you also remove all cares, you remove those values, you remove the things that matter to you. Being a parent is stressful. Succeeding in a career is stressful. Being an athlete of any kind is stressful, right? Life is stressful and that's okay. Right?

What is right, or what is adaptive, depends on the circumstance. Your mindset will help, but the reality matters too. Also you have mindsets because of the reality that we live in.

When you reinterpret stress not as evidence of your inadequacy, but as evidence of how much you care about something, it can transform the way you think about it

When patients get help from a dedicated and trusted doctor, it isn't just the doctor's cures that make patients better. The expectations that patients have, their trust in their physicians and the rituals embedded in the art of medicine all play a role in outcomes

When you get this information, you immediately make up a story that helps explain it like I did. It was like, "That makes sense." A gene predisposes me to feel less full after eating. So i am actually ok eating less.

We are what we believe. The belief of our genes mattered more than the genes itself. If we feel we are exercising, we are exercising enough to get the benefits. So never tell anyone their exercise is not sufficient. The really serious ones who need more exercise do not need this kind of advice anyways

People drinking diet shakes felt more full if we lied to them about that and people drinking a normal shake felt less full if they thought it was a diet shake

When we say it's healthy, the assumption is that it's not filling, not indulgent, not tasty and kind of in some cases disgusting and depriving. Those beliefs ans associations with healthy food, don't just lead to us not wanting to eat those things, changing our behavior, but they might also be influencing our physiology in ways that keep us from getting the benefits of eating healthy foods.

The goal of eating is to feel like you're eating enough, to feel like you're eating indulgently, feeling satisfied, feeling good with what you eat. So that became the goal for me. And it didn't mean I just threw all caution to the wind and ate only milkshakes and fries. In fact, I found that I didn't actually crave those things when I wasn't trying to avoid them. If I went about life with the goal of what can I eat that will actually make me feel satisfied, feel that sense of enough and that was the goal. I would choose things naturally that were healthier and not all the time. Sometimes I would choose a hamburger, but that's what felt right for me. And it was freeing and it was profound. It really truly was the study that changed me most on my journey.

How you see yourself and your circumstances will affect what you see, how you act and what occurs as a result
