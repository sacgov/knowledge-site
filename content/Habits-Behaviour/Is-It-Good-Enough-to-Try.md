# Is it Good Enough to Try?

# Holding to a High Standard

Much of life's challenge consists of holding ourselves to a high enough standard. Am i holding myself to a high enough standard.

**Succeeding to do a thing, is very hard, trying to do it is much easier.**

Want to try to make a million dollars? Buy a lottery ticket. Your odds of winning may not be very good, but you did try, and trying was what you wanted. In fact, you tried your best, since you only had one dollar left after buying lunch. Maximising the odds of goal achievement using available resources: is this not intelligence?

It's only when you want, above all else, to actually flip the switch—without quotation and without consolation prizes just for trying—that you will actually put in the effort to actually maximise the probability.

## There is no Best

**Don't try your best. Win, or fail. There is no best.**

## On Doing the Impossible

At first, I thought "perseverance" meant working 14-hour days.

1. What are the important problems in your field?
2. Why aren't you working on them?

To do things that are very difficult or "impossible"

1. You have to not run away. That takes seconds.
2. Then you have to work. That takes hours.
3. Then you have to stick at it. That takes years.

Putting extra ordinary effort In important matters is paramount.
**A 'strong' effort usually results in only mediocre results.**

Whenever we are attempting anything truly worthwhile our effort must be as if our life is at stake, just as if we were under a physical attack! It is this extraordinary effort—an effort that drives us beyond what we thought we were capable of—that ensures victory in battle and success in life's endeavours.

Your goal is not to do better, to try desperately, or even to try extraordinarily. Your goal is to get out of the box.
