# Workplace Habits

Notes from the book [What Got You Here Won't Get You There](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84525.What_Got_You_Here_Won_t_Get_You_There)

I might assume i am successful because of the habits i currently have. For example this can be politics in the workplace. This might be a superstition of causality. I might be successful inspite of my appalling behaviour and not because of it.

X is very rude and not empathetic. He is a workaholic and promoted multiple times. He assumes his behaviour is causing the promotions. The coach tells him that it was because of his engineering skills he is promoted. He would have actually been promoted much higher had he acted nicer.

## Twenty Habits to Stop

1. **Winning too much**: The need to win at all costs and in all situations - when it matters, when it doesn’t, and when it’s totally beside the point.
2. **Adding too much value**: The overwhelming desire to add our two cents to everything.
3. **Passing judgment**: The need to rate others and impose our standards on them
4. **Making destructive comments**: The needless sarcasms and cutting remarks that we think make us sound sharp and witty.
5. **Starting with “No,” “But,” or “However”**: The overuse of these negative qualifiers which secretly say to everyone, “I’m right. You’re wrong.”
6. **Telling the world how smart we are**: Need to show people we’re smarter than they think we are.
7. **Speaking when angry**: Using emotional volatility as a management tool.
8. **Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work”**: The need to share our negative thoughts even when we weren’t asked.
9. **Withholding information:** The refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others.
10. **Failing to give proper recognition**: The inability to praise and reward.
11. **Claiming credit that we don’t deserve**: The most annoying way to overestimate our contribution to any success.
12. **Making excuses**: The need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people excuse us for it.
13. **Clinging to the past**: The need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from our past; a subset of blaming everyone else.
14. **Playing favourites**: Failing to see that we are treating someone unfairly.
15. **Refusing to express regret**: The inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit when we’re wrong, or recognise how our actions affect others.
16. **Not listening**: The most passive-aggressive form of disrespect for colleagues.
17. **Failing to express gratitude**: The most basic form of bad manners.
18. **Punishing the messenger**: The misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually trying to help us.
19. **Passing the buck**: The need to blame everyone but ourselves.
20. **An excessive need to be “me”**: Exalting our faults as virtues simply because they’re who we are.

## Change for Better

1. **Feedback:** When feedback is given to you in any form, never respond by arguing about it.
2. **Apologising:** If you realise that you have done something wrong, apologise. Swallow a bit of pride, go up to the person, and just apologise. Likely, you’ll both feel better for it
3. **Telling the world:** What are you going to do to change? Apologies don’t mean anything if they’re not coupled with some effort to change.
4. **Listening:** When someone speaks to you, listen to them. Speak slowly
5. **Thanking:** Thank everyone who contributes to your success, both directly and in public opportunities when given the chance.
6. **Following up:** Wait a few months, then ask the person you’ve apologised to if things are still seeming okay and if you are doing well on your “advertised” plan of attack. Stay diligent yourself, and try to remind yourself often of your goals
7. **Practicing feedforward:** At this point, you’re making real progress on your negative habits. Now, step back and ask for some future suggestions on where you should go with these changes. This is going back to the first step
