# Stumbling upon Happiness

## Happier than Others

If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.

Montesquieu said this 300 years ago. We’re still working on this one.

## Thinking of the Future

- Human brains have an ability to imagine, to see the world as it has never been before.
- We are different from every other animal is **that they think about the future**
- Our brain makes predictions incredibly quickly and about nearly everything in life. When our experiences don't match what our brain expects, we feel surprised.
- The frontal lobe is responsible for planning and anxiety — two key future-oriented functions.
- We like to daydream because the mere dream itself can be a joy.

## Imagination ’s Four Shortcomings

1. Imagination tends to add and remove details, but people do not realize that key details may be fabricated or missing from the imagined scenario.
2. Imagined futures (and pasts) are more like the present than they actually will be (or were).
3. Imagination fails to realise that things will feel different once they actually happen. Most notably, the psychological immune system will make bad things feel not so bad as they were imagined to feel.
4. It takes liberties without telling us it has done so.

## Comparison

The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another. Avarice over-rates the difference between poverty and riches: ambition, that between a private and a public station: vain-glory, that between obscurity and extensive reputation. The person under the influence of any of those extravagant passions, is not only miserable in his actual situation, but is often disposed to disturb the peace of society, in order to arrive at that which he so foolishly admires. The slightest observation, however, might satisfy him, that, in all the ordinary situations of human life, a well-disposed mind may be equally calm, equally cheerful, and equally contented. Some of those situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others: but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardour which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice; or to corrupt the future tranquillity of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly, or by remorse from the horror of our own injustice.

## Perfectionism

Perfectionism is a self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this primary thought:
If I look perfect, live perfectly, and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimise the painful feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.
Perfectionism is self-destructive simply because there is no such thing as perfect.

## Bias in Thinking

In few weeks even earthquake survivors tend to return to previous levels of optimism.
The wheel chair and the lottery guys reach the same level of happiness.
Experience is unobservable to everyone except the person who it happens to.

It’s entirely possible they are just as happy or even more so being in a much worse of situation.
Same goes towards thinking we might have been more happier if we had a different outcome

They only think they’re happy because they don’t know what they are missing. That’s actually the point. Not knowing what we are missing is the very thing that allows us to be happy despite not having some other opportunity.

When we imagine the future we often do so in the blind spot of our minds eye.

## The Experience-stretching Hypothesis

- Experiential background can dramatically change your happiness levels. Once you know something exists and have experienced pleasure from it, then your definition of happiness changes compared to what it was in the past.
- So a rich person can feel sad when he becomes poor. A poor person can be happier in the same situation. Happiness is just secretion of enough chemicals in the brain. It is the brain that regulates it and not the situation
- Experience and awareness are closely related but not the same. Experience refers to partaking in an event. Awareness refers to being cognizant that the event is happening.

## Reality

1. Our reality is merely just a version of reality. It's just our interpretation of the world.
2. Our brains “fill in” all sorts of information each day. Our predictions are influenced by our experiences. We make assumptions about things that we predict based on the previous experiences we have had or heard about before.
3. We tend to remember what did happen, but not what didn't happen.

## How Reality is Morphed

- It is easy for our mind to notice what is there (a dog barking) but very difficult to notice the absence of something (you rarely recognize a dog not barking as an event because it's just silence).
- The silences, misses, and absences of events are crucial in determining the real world implications of things, but we rarely pick up on them.
- A life with blindness is about a lot more than being blind, but when we imagine life as a blind person we tend to only think about seeing and forget all the other parts of life.
- Similarly a romantic life is not cuddles and watching movies together. But fights and responsibility together.
- When we imagine the distant future, we tend to imagine things in generalities and gloss over the details. When we imagine things in the near future (like tomorrow), we tend to think in concrete details.

## What Could Have Been or Will Be

1. When scientists make erroneous predictions they almost always err by predicting that the future will be too much like the present.
2. I have money now, so i think i could have made this kind of money anyways and that i should have had more romantic interludes. I become sad thinking that my life is so barren. But the actual reality is that i was not financial ready then or at least felt that way back then. That being a construction from previous experiences and the inception goes on.
3. We use the present as a way to imagine the future and influence memories of the past.
4. **Memories and imaginations are often closer to our current reality than actual reality.**
5. One of the hallmarks of depression is that when depressed people think future events they can't imagine liking them very much.

## Baseline

1. Starting point matters because we often end up close to where we started. (This could be applied to many areas of life: memories, socioeconomic status, education, etc.)
2. Happiness is moving uphill and not reaching that point.
3. Habituation effect decreases pleasure with repeated cycles, but it can fade over time.

## Presentism

1. Presentism refers to judging historical events or people by modern day standards.
2. It is largely useless and unfair because you can't expect historical figures to make the same decisions as we do now because they lived in a very different context.
3. It's “sort of like arresting someone in the 1920 s for not wearing a seatbelt.”
4. Don’t beat yourself up for your past. Every one is built different.

## Overestimation of Pain

Most people overestimate how terrible traumatic events will actually be.
Quadriplegics and earthquake victims generally rate themselves as much happier than people would ever imagine.

We all look at our version of reality through rose coloured lenses, but that version still needs to feel credible. If it's too good, then we will reject it.
People actually feel less pain when they believe they are suffering for something of great value.

Add meaning to your suffering. Rather [forge a meaning](Living/Personal-Renewal.md#Meaning%20) instead of finding one.

## Psychological Immune Systems

Gets triggered when we experience particularly traumatic events. These systems protect us from events that we would assume would be intensely painful and thus we are able to recover from them better than we often assume we would.

Defences are more likely to be triggered by intense than mild suffering. Thus, we mis-predict their own emotional reactions to misfortunes of different sizes.

We’re more likely to look for and find a positive view of things we’re stuck with than of things we’re not. Better to settle than have a way out. Arranged vs love marriages.

It’s only when we can’t change our experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience. This part is forging meaning when it is difficult to find one.

## Overvalue Freedom

We can easily imagine all of the benefits freedom will provide to us, but we tend to underestimate the fact that freedom hinders us from moving forward because we are constantly debating if there are better options out there.

Only when we have fully committed and gone “all in” do we reach an inescapable situation where our brain can easily justify our behaviour and circumstances.

Simply writing about traumatic events — especially explaining the event itself — people show increased psychological and physiological well being including increased viral antibodies.

## Biases

1. We tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times not the most likely of times.
2. There is little evidence to the idea that women are more irritable during their menstrual cycle.
3. Wealth will make you much happier when you go from poverty to the middle class but not much more happy beyond that. Some making $5 M per year is about as happy as someone making $100 K per year.
4. Perpetuating beliefs : Happiness of parents is not raised at all. We continue to perpetuate this belief. People who believe kids are great tend to have them → pass on that belief → people who believe the opposite → avoid having kids.
5. Someone who feels going to ms will make them happy → goes to ms → perpetuates belief.
6. We don’t always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique.
7. We are sensitive to relative rather than absolute values.

## How We Think

1. What someone is
2. What someone has
3. How someone stands in the estimation of others

A man never feels the loss of things which it never occurs to him to ask for; he is just as happy without them; whilst another, who may have a hundred times as much, feels miserable because he has not got the one thing he wants.

What a man is contributes much more to his happiness than what he has, or how he is regarded by others. What a man is, and so what he has in his own person, is always the chief thing to consider; for his individuality accompanies him always and everywhere, and gives its colour to all his experiences
