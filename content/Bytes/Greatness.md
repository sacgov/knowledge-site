# Greatness

Transcript of the [Nike Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYP9AGtLvRg).

It's just something we made up. We've come to believe that greatness is a gift reserved for a chosen few For prodigies, For superstars and the rest of us can only stand by watching

Greatness is not some rare DNA strand Greatness is not more unique to us than breathing is. We're all capable of it. All of us

Some people are told they were born with greatness. Some people tell themselves.

If greatness doesn't come knocking at your door, maybe you should go knock on its door

Sometimes greatness is about overcoming insurmountable adversity Sometimes is just fun

Greatness isn't always measured in tenths of a point It's a bit bigger than that

Greatness is something you plan Most of the time is just something you try

Greatness is a scary thing, Until it isn't.

If we think greatness is supposed to look a certain way, act a certain way and play in a certain way, we certainly need to rethink some things

Is it speed or endurance? Does it happen in two hours or for or six? Is it finishing strong? Or barely finishing? Yes

Is greatness worth fighting for? What do you think?

If we are facing our fears, we're pointed in the right direction Even if that direction is upside down

It's not the biggest stadium in the world Not the biggest players either But the pursuit of greatness is kinda big enough, isn't it?

You don't need an official court, an official net Or official uniforms to be officially great

Greatness speaks for itself, once it learns to talk

Greatness needs a lot of things But it doesn't need an audience

Greatness is not born, It's made

If you try to tell the guy with the sword he's not great because he's not famous Be my guest

Greatness is for all of us This is not about lowering expectations It's about raising them for every last one of us Because greatness is not in one special place And it's not in one special person Greatness is wherever somebody is trying to find it.
