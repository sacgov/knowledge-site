# 30 Life Lessons

1. That family, flowers and walks in the woods would bring me more happiness than cars, watches and houses ever would.
2. That getting super-fit would multiply my creativity, productivity and prosperity considerably.
3. That your choice of relationship partner is one of the main sources of your success (or failure), joy (or misery) and tranquility (or worry).
4. That good friendships are priceless treasures. And that old friends are the most precious ones.
5. That people putting you down is a sign of your increasing success.
6. That small daily victories, performed with disciplined consistency over extended periods of time, lead to revolutionary results.
7. That when I didn’t get what I desired it was because the universe had something a whole lot better in mind.
8. That being scared just means you’re about to grow. And that frequent discomfort is the price of accelerated progress.
9. That if you risk all for love and it doesn’t work out, there is no failure because all love stories are, in truth, hero tales. And no growth of the heart is a waste. Ever.
10. That working diligently without concern for the rewards is the very behavior that brings the rewards.
11. That life has a fabulous feedback system showing you what you are doing right by where you are winning (and what you need to improve by where you’re frustrated).
12. That the humbler the person, the stronger the character.
13. That we get what we settle for. (So stop settling for what you don’t want.)
14. That sometimes silence is the loudest reply you can give.
15. That the way people make you feel when you interact with them tells you everything you need to know about them.
16. That taking a lot of time off would make me twice as productive.
17. That feeding the trolls is a waste of your time.
18. That journaling is praying on paper. And every prayer is heard.
19. That a genuinely rich life costs a lot less than you think.
20. That the best use of money is to create experiences and memories and not to secure objects and possessions.
21. That willpower is built by doing difficult things. So do more difficult things.
22. That it’s better to read a few books deeply than consume many books lightly.
23. That hardship is the birthplace of heroism. Honour your scars as they have you.
24. That the majority of human beings have wonderful hearts and they’ll show them to you if you make them feel safe.
25. That elderly people have the best stories. And deserve the highest respect.
26. That all life has huge value. Don’t ever step on an ant.
27. That when you feel most alone, your higher power is closest to you.
28. That not every hour of the day and not every day of the week needs to be used “productively” and “grinding.” Taking naps, staring at the stars and, sometimes, doing nothing are pursuits absolutely necessary for a life of unlimited beauty.
29. That respecting yourself is vastly more important than being liked by others.
30. That life’s too short to play small with your highness.
