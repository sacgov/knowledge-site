# Aetiology Vs Teleology

Aetiology : The investigation or attribution of the cause or reason for something, often expressed in terms of historical or mythical explanation.

Teleology : The explanation of phenomena inn terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.

Aetiology: _I’ve got that boss, so I can’t work._
Teleology: _I don’t want to work, so I’ll create an awful boss,_ or _I don’t want to acknowledge my incapable self, so I’ll create an awful boss._

Aetiology: _My mother told me this, so i do not like her_
Teleology: _I do not want to like my mother, so i bring up this bad memory regularly_
