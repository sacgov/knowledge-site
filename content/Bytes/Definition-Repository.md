# Pareto Principle

The **Pareto principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few")

## Hell Yes

When the brain goes yusssss!

## Antifragile

Anti-fragility is a property of systems in which they increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. The concept was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book, Antifragile, and in technical papers.
