# On Ambition

I see no reason to spend your life writing poems unless your goal is to write great poems

We fail in part because we have little ambition to succeed.

Ambition is not easy to attain.

I would fail rather not be among the greats said Keats at 22.

If the goal is to remain content, ambition is neither sensible nor necessary

But if the goal is to do anything worthwhile, it is the most necessary.

The only to become any good is trying to be the best as humans inherently fail at their goals

The society sets us up for mediocrity as we it wants to see us happy. But do you want to be happy or the best. You can be happy and pretty successfully but not the best. The only people who are happy being the best are either lying or genuinely love what they are best. If you like me or everyone else loves not what we want to best at for whatever reasons we are at a loss.

Getting a publication can be an achievement for academics or a grant. But it is poor substitution for something that would live long like newtonâ€™s laws or a seminal book.

I do not lament we find ourselves incapable of such achievement but that we that we do not entertain the thought.

See Also [Kinder version of success](Success/Kinder-Version-of-Success.md).

Having a large ego in ambition is not petty at least in my books.

Ambition needs to learnt again and again. It requires an upheaval of our beliefs.

Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything
