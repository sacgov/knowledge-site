# Taking Action

# Mindset

If you don’t see yourself as the kind of person who has what it takes to accomplish world-class results, you won’t even start to do the actions required to achieve world-class results. [Desperation towards a Goal](Habits-Behaviour/Guilt-And-Motivation.md#Desperation%20towards%20a%20Goal)
People who do great things typically have a great drive to do things.

## Action & Will

Action is commonplace, right action is not. As a discipline, it’s not any kind of action that will do, but directed action. Everything in the service of the whole. Step by step, action by action, we’ll dismantle the obstacles in front of us. With persistence and flexibility, we’ll act in the best interest of our goals. Action requires courage, not brash application or brute force. Our movements and decisions define us: We must act with deliberation, boldness, and persistence. Those are the attributes of right and effective action. Not thinking of evasion or aid from others. Action is the solution and the cure to our predicaments.

Will is our internal power, which can never be affected by the outside world. It is our final trump card. If action is what we do when we still have some agency over our situation, the will is what we depend on when agency has depleted. Placed in some situation that seems undeniably negative, we can turn it into a learning, a humbling experience, a chance to provide comfort to others. That’s will power. It needs cultivation.

## Action Delayed is Greatness Betrayed

Quit Excuses and deliver Results Start a campaign of massive personal growth. Life really does favour the obsessed. Great fortune truly does shine on those mesmerised by their gorgeous ambitions.
Success has far less to do with your genetics and much more to do with your habits Can’t is a tower that victims lock themselves. Doesn’t reward those who blame their circumstances when things aren’t working and passively wait for outside help.

## On Passing of time

Spring has passed.
Summer has gone.
And Winter is here.
And the song that I meant to sing remains unsung.
For I have spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument.

Applied to today, a reminder that how you live each day really does matter. It changes the future.

We wake up every day with 100 ten-minute time blocks at our disposal. If you feel like you’re in a rut, try doing something different than normal with two or three of today’s blocks.

## Why Would I Succeed. Am I Special?

Everyone is special. You only have to believe so.
Believing is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

## Working towards Our Dream

[Henry David Thoreau](%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau%20) in Walden

> I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours

What do I think I can do? What does the economy say I can do? What do you think I can do? What does my mother think I can do?

**What would you love? is the right question.**

**Refuse to stay discouraged**. I didn't say refuse to get discouraged; we're all going to get discouraged. Not everything we try is going to work out. So decline to stay discouraged.

So those three things:

1. Be specific about your dream;
2. Decline to stay discouraged;
3. Be in service of your dream through the growth that happens,

Now, not one of us can go back and change what's back there, but every single one of us can decide what's going to be out there.
