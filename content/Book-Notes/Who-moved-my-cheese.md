# Who Moved My Cheese

It is curious little story of rats and cheese.

1. If you do not change, you can become extinct.
2. What Would You Do If You Weren't Afraid?
3. Cheese has not suddenly vanished, but has dwindled from continual eating. What am i continuously eating into?
4. The Quicker You Let Go Of Old Cheese, The Sooner You Can Enjoy New Cheese They Keep Moving The Cheese. Get Ready For The Cheese To Move
