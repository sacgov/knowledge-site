# Art of a Good Life

Notes from Rolf Dobelli's [Art of a good life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36340275-the-art-of-the-good-life)

1. There are no master plans as there is no predicting threats
2. A good life is not stable but constant readjustment to keep it stable
3. Eat dinner at home with family. inflexible planning. No working on weekends
4. Make pledges not goals.
5. Reality does not care about your feelings.
6. Put black boxes in our mind. Check what we are feeling, doing and progress.
7. When we fail, we must accept that we had a bad strategy and not bad timing.
8. With each fuckup life gets incrementally better. But only if we course correct
9. We now have 1000s of photos useless and backing them up, sorting them. As opposed to the camera based single photos. Such a waste of time. Counter productivity.
10. If you can do without it, drop it. Especially if it is technology and not natural to humans
11. Remember that each one starts differently because of their ovarian lottery
12. limit gossip and whining, stick to promises you make, stay polite
13. Say no by default.
14. The only prediction of a good life is how well you sleep
15. Prefer experiences over objects. Communal time is better than alone time.
16. Give special importance to things like jobs which make up 40% of our life
17. Live modestly but have fuck you money saved up.
18. Stop beating yourself for your incompetencies. What is an area i am far better than others.
19. Do what you can and not what you wish you could
20. People change, time change. we never step in the same river twice.
21. Goals are guideposts. Without them we get nowhere. Unrealistic goals are killjoys
22. The remembering self and experiencing self are vastly different. We drop all the experiences we have. I might remember my childhood fondly when the actual day would be filled with stress of homework, the same as office stress today. We just do not remember it that way
23. When we are in a prison it does not matter what time we were in it, the experience that matters is only of the few last days. Same goes for a vacations.
24. Take more frequent vacations than a long one. A long one is beneficial though to completely tune off the daily works
25. We must deliberately make time to relive happy moments from the past
26. Fortitudine Vincimus - By endurance we conquer
27. Blaming parents has an expiry date.
28. Have principles that cannot be negotiated. If i would not do it for a 10th of money i would not do it. Not badmouthing family, putting photos of kids online.
29. We must believe there is a light at the end of tunner even with current pledges
30. Do not rethink your beliefs at every instance. This is the same 100% commitment
31. Fulfilling focused work is better than any meditation
32. Last of human freedoms is our attitude towards external events. It is the only thing that cannot be taken away from a person
33. Always donate money but not time except to friends
34. Do not consume news at all
35. Avoid anything that is free and not naturally occurring
36. Do not confuse what is new with what is relevant
37. The world is fundamentally amoral. we make our ways around it
38. Do not mimic successful people without understanding what made them successful
39. It is better to approximately right than being precisely wrong
40. If you cannot discern something as bullshit, it is better to assume it bullshit
