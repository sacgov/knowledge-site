# Thinking Clearly

## Being Hyper Realistic

What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making, but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you. You create your own reality, and you believe it.

Hold yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail. See beyond your fears. Recognise your assumptions. Harness your internal strength. Silence your internal critic. Correct your misconceptions about luck and about success. Accept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference. Open your hearts to your bountiful blessings.

Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains -- they are your excuses, rationalisations, shortcuts, justifications, your surrender. They are fictions you perceive as reality. Choose to see through them. Choose to let them go. You are the creator of your reality. With that empowerment comes complete responsibility.

What do you fear? What lies do you tell yourself? How do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions? What reality are you creating for yourself?

## Human Misjudgements

Being outside of your circle of competence, stress, rushing or urgency, fixation on an outcome, information overload, being in a group where social cohesion comes into play, and being in the presence of an “authority.

Preconceived notions of the way it should be cloud us from being able to see reality

1. Reinforcements - Incentives matter more than we care. Think on them carefully. Federal Agents doing work better if they can leave home early.
2. Psychological denial - denial of truths as truthful as the day and sun of one’s loss and shortcomings. Accept it. Epictetus, slave maimed but favoured by gods.
3. Bias from consistency - Work though life committed in cognitive dissonance without resolving what we are going through. What you think may change what you do, But more importantly what you do might change what you think.
4. Bias from Pavlovian association - Misconstruing past correlation as a reliable basis for decision-making. Thinking a bell ring would always mean food is ready.
5. Bias from reciprocation tendency - Can you help me 2 days - No. Can you do at least one day and the compliance rate went up by about a third. Just asking gives 1 in 6. We reciprocate animosity too and its even more harmful.
6. Social Proof - People around me dictate what i should be doing.
7. Bias for what we know to do well - To the man with a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail. Better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.
8. Bias from contrast - A cold hand feels hotter and the hot hand colder in lukewarm water.
9. Bias from over-influence by authority - Milgram electric experiment
10. Deprival Super Reaction Syndrome - Snatching the bone that the dog just received. Something possessed just about now and it’s threatened.
11. Bias from envy/jealousy - Learn to grow out of it.
12. Bias from liking distortion - Tendency to especially like oneself, one's own kind, and one's own idea structures, and the tendency to be especially susceptible to being mislead by someone liked. Also not learning from someone disliked.
13. Stress-induced mental change - Stress breaks our decision making ability
14. Scarcity induced bias - I suck at flirting and it affects my ability to do work.

## Thinking Rationally

1. Check parts of problem outside my circle of competence. Get Help.
2. Stress, Rushing or Urgency - breaks our decision making ability
3. Fixation on an outcome. Consider alternatives and worst case scenarios.
4. Incentives matter more than we care. Think on them carefully. Federal Agents doing work better if they can leave home early. List Incentives detracting me.
5. Denial of truths and forgetting of one’s loss and shortcomings. Be Hyper Realistic.
6. What am i seeing in the environment I am and because of it.
7. Using a solution we know - To the man with a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail. Better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.
8. Bias from contrast - A cold hand feels hotter and the hot hand colder in lukewarm water.
9. Loss Aversion. What loss am i afraid of.
10. Resentment, envy/jealousy - Learn to grow out of it.
