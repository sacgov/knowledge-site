# Memories Vs Experiences

A screeching sound at the end of the symphony ruined it for X, the whole experience. They had 20 mins of glorious music that did not amount to anything because all they was left with was a memory of a screeching sound. It was all he got to keep.

It is important to note what we experience vs what we try to store in the memory.

There is an experiencing self that lives in the present, but is capable of reliving the past. But it has only the present The remembering self is a story teller. What we get to keep from our experiences is our story.

A critical part of the story is how it ends. A story is changes, significant moments and endings. All experiences are ignored and dropped mostly.

Time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story. Remembering self also makes the decisions. We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences.

When we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. So if you want to maximise the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things.

In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story.
