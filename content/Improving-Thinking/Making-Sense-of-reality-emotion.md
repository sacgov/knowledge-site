# Making Sense of Reality and Emotion

This article is not about reality. It is about how to get in grips with reality, understanding emotions. It is about the tricks the mind plays which makes us deviate from reality.

## What is Reality?

Reality is a complex mental construction of your own making, but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you. You create your own reality, and you believe it.

Everybody sees their own reality. Reality just means what seems real to the person observing it. It does not have anything to do with the actual truth. We tend to believe our reality as the truth. For most purposes, what we see is our reality as well as the real truth.

**We do not see things as they are, we see things as we are.**
