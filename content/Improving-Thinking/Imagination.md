# Imagination

**Imagination isn't what we think, it's how we think.** Imagination is situated between our perceptions and our understanding.

It means the universe around us is hidden in plain sight; We can't see it.

If you spin a ball around and let it go, Will it go straight or will it curve or will it do something else? Leonardo da Vinci saw it curve.

If it looks like a duck, if it sounds like a duck, it's probably a duck.

**We pick out a bit of what we know and will fill in the rest of the picture.**

We do this by the way we dress - what do we do? We're trying to suggest something about ourselves that's more than just the clothing.

This idea is that **some surface quality is going to reflect some inner essence**.

Shiny will mean new, young will mean fresh, From that little bit, we spread out, and we have a reality, and this is the illusion of objectivity.

We do this much more quickly with people, and without a second thought.

We elect leaders who are taller.

We think that attractive people are more honest, We pay them more and we forgive them more often.

And if we find people that we don't like to be polite about it - we generally will lean into thinking they're bad or at least they're suspect.

And again, we take some little bit of behaviour, and we build it out to a trait:

"Oh, that person's shy,", "Oh, that person is competitive," Winners and losers; introvert, extrovert; athletic, uncoordinated; risk-takers, wallflowers.

When we apply on ourselves, **It limits our identity, it limits what we might choose to do.**

When other do to us, it influences how they perceive us and how they respond to us.

And it's taking something that's ambiguous and open to interpretation and grabbing ahold of one part of it that which is familiar and extrapolating. This is a natural ability, and it happens very quickly, and it happens very unconsciously.

They're places where the outcomes are not predictable, which include gambling, athletics and investing, you see superstitious thoughts and behaviours.

You see where they have talismans, objects and magical thinking.

Because we're thinking with our own voice and we're figuring things out, so clearly this is the most important mental ability we have, and it's obviously in control.

And we get down to, How do we control our inner voice? By language.

How we think of ourselves, and the words like "winner" and "loser", "success" and "failure", and we take that little bit of experience that we named, and we put a whole reality around it.

Or somebody else does that as well.

And so words evoke experiences, not realities.

And if you listen to that, and you understand it, then if we use a number of words, as we put those experiences together, A story forms

Stories, by the way, are our first information storage and retrieval device, and they're also our favourite way of reasoning and a favourite past time.

And the thing is that if you think about that, if you share that with friends, if you naturalise it, then that begins to feel real, and then it becomes something called fate or destiny.

**Remember that we donâ€™t see the world the way it is, but rather as our instruments allow.**
