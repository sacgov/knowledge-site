# Seeing the World

## How to See Clearly?

### Looking within

Look within. You have the answers you've been searching for. Ask yourself the important questions and then listen to your inner voice. Such advice is especially common in countries with individualistic cultures, such as the United States. We believe our answers have to come from within because each of us is a unique individual on our own special journey. We celebrate the idea of marching to our own drummer. We disparage people who follow the herd.

### Conjuring Reasons

I felt someone is a perfect match for me. When it was in fact not a perfect match. When it went downhill, i could recognise how i was biased.

People have all sorts of notions on house buying. But they finally buy something different and sometimes completely different.

No one ever says i have an idea. They concoct some idea because we want to make sense of the world and ourselves in some way.

They presented participants with two photographs of two different women and asked the participants, to pick the one that you think is most attractive. And they would also ask them, could you tell me why you picked the one you did? And people would say, oh, well that woman, she had particularly pretty eyes or whatever. Well unbeknownst to the participant on some trials, they would show people the picture they actually had not chosen, and pretended it's the one they had. The researcher would pick up picture B, show it to the participant and say, well, tell me why you chose this one? Now the first remarkable thing was that people didn't detect the subterfuge most of the time.

I think only about a quarter of the time, did they realise that the experimenter had switched the pictures. But even more remarkable, they quite easily explained the reasons why they had chosen this particular picture. Even though it's not the one they chose. They quite easily said, oh, it's because of her eyes or her hair or whatever. And the researchers went to some lengths to try to see, is there a difference in the reasons people give for the wrong picture compared to the reasons they give for the right picture? And they couldn't find any differences, they weren't of different length and different detail, different content. It's as if people could just make up an explanation, even when we know in this case, it was for something they hadn't actually chosen.

In one case, there was a male participant who was shown a picture that he hadn't chosen. And he says that the woman in the picture, she's radiant, I would rather have approached her in a bar than the other one. I like earrings, even though he initially found the other woman who was not wearing earrings more attractive. And it's kind of remarkable, not just that people were willing to go along with the replacement photograph that the researchers picked, but were effortlessly coming up with explanations for why they in fact had picked the picture that they didn't pick.

And it makes you wonder about how much we're confabulating, even when we're explaining our real choices.

### Deliberation Doesn't Mean Correct

Many of us think that the more rational and deliberate we can be in our decision making the better. Surely we think the person who is asked to come up with a list of reasons for her decision will be happier with a decision, because they has arrived at her conclusion deliberately and thoughtfully. Studies find the opposite as true. That the people who give detailed reasons, particularly for things that are hard to explain like a romantic partner, they mislead themselves.

We tend to look at reasons that can only be verbalised when we write pluses and minuses. But a lot of times there is not way to verbalise what we are feeling and we miss on them if we do not go by our gut feeling.

we actually tend to think things to have greater impact on us than they typically do. We are good at what will bring happiness to us and what would not. But not to a great extent.

The people who know us well are good observers of our behaviour, and they can deduce from our actions what we like and what we don't. And sometimes we have theories ourselves that just go awry and don't match those preferences. So it's the people who are good observers of us who often can deduce our feelings better than we can.

### All Humans a Alike (mostly)

We maybe underestimate how much, sometimes we're all alike in our preferences. We tend to like the same kind of movies, and for college women, we have similar impressions of another college man. This means not getting a date would mean no date and getting a date would mean lots of dates

If another woman liked me, that would mean a lot of women would like me. This is the result of a Dan Gilbert's study. This is outright depressing.
This means someone getting a job will get lot of jobs and someone getting a date will get lots of dates. [Unfairness of the Game](Winning-the-game-of-life.md#Unfairness%20of%20the%20Game)
You either play games in which you have the unfair advantage or work hard to at least do averagely well in games we are disadvantaged.

## How We See Ourselves?

We are harsher in how we see ourselves as we have fuller picture of ourselves than we have of others. Also evolutionarily we have a higher instinct to correct ourselves than correct others.

### Chatter

The inner critic just wants to keep us safe. It wants to improve us. We also call it chatter.
[Temporal Distancing](Chatter.md#Temporal%20Distancing)
[How is Chatter Created ?](Chatter.md#How%20is%20Chatter%20Created%20?)

when we make a mistake or fail, it's scary, we feel frightened, we feel threatened.

1. We flee in shame from the perceived judgments of others
2. We freeze and get stuck in rumination

### Self Compassion & Comparison

The belief that we need to be hard on ourselves, criticise ourselves to succeed or reach your goals or make a change is actually the number one block to self-compassion.

We all have to feel special and above average just for baseline to feel good about ourselves. This social comparison is really built into the need for self-esteem

Self compassion is when we do not have to better than others to feel better about ourselves

## Emotions

Emotions are channels of how we interact the world. Westerners feel emotions as something that comes from inside out. And that there are a few basic emotions. Easterners see emotions as a thing between 2 objects. So the intensity of the emotion does not make sense to them. As they see emotions as something outside them

westerners cant bottle emotions. They feel stress as they feel they are in charge of their emotions. Easterners do not feel the same burnout from the emotions

Gratitude, praise and resentment nothing are the same across cultures.

Love as we see it today did not exist a few 100 years back.

Emotions are how we perceive our current situation vs the normal situation. Perceive is key here. Emotions provide us a way to fix our future

## How We See Others?

We need to think about other people's minds in order to figure out who our friends are, who to avoid, whom to punish, whether to punish. And, we need to read people's intentions in any ordinary interaction, like having a conversation, and figuring out what to say, and how to respond. Our ability to read what is happening in other people's minds is like an invisible compass guiding us through life. But sometimes, it leads us astray. We misread other people's intentions, especially when we are hurt, or angry.

we take different cues from people as we're having that conversation, whether they're nodding their heads, whether they're pausing, whether they look confused, and so on. And, so, we take in all of that information to figure out what people are thinking

Young children think their reality is what everybody's reality is. After 5 people start thinking in terms of their own reality.

We see the intentions and also judge what aspects of it are moral. In some cases like food and sex, we downplay intent. That fact that you did it is bad enough.

So when a building comes down, Is it a coordinated attack or an accident. sep 11.

Is the convict reaching for purse or a gun There are many cases in which we don't catch our mistakes, and we're not able to fix them after the fact.

It's really hard to take that step back and think about what are the situational stresses and influences that could be leading to other people's actions

## How Others See Us?
We try to guess what others think of us. Are my flaws on display or did they think we are cool. Research suggests this is not the case. Our perceptions of social interactions are biased.

There is a liking gap. Acquainted for the first time. We underestimate how much the other person liked the conversation. People underestimated how much the room-mate likes us.

We are pessimistic about our social lives. Anytime we really care how others think of us, we are going to be hyper aware of our failings. Even after people are familiar we still have these social illusions. Conversations end faster or takes way longer and not how a single party wants.

People thought they were invisible but they can pierce the invisibility cloak others don. We believe we have a cloak around us, but then again we also think they see us as we see ourselves - harshly. It is really hard catching people watching us. But we are always being watched. Our appearance matters a lot.

we underestimate how much others think about us after an argument. These social illusions help us become socially savvy
