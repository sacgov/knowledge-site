# Understanding the Brain

## Triune Brain Theory

According to the model, the basal ganglia are in charge of our primal instincts, the limbic system is in charge of our emotions and the neocortex is responsible for objective or rational thoughts.

**Reptilian Brain** - oldest and preset to prevent hassles. Hear rate, respiration etx autonomous functions
**NeoCortex** - abstract thinking and language
**Limbic system** - social behaviour and rewards

Brain weighs 3 pounds. But takes 25 percent of blood supply.

To pack a lot of tissue it has gyri and sulci. Ups and lows. It has left and right connected by bridges. Left is analytical, right is creative. There is a specialisation in brain areas but they work together.

Speech - word, vocabulary come from left but right gives the harmony to the voice. Independent yet interconnected

It takes in outside stimulation through special sensory organs like the eyes, the nose and our ears. Our brains respond to the outside world mainly through the motor system. Voluntary movement is the result of a muscle contraction happening at the command of a corresponding motor neuron.

**Our sensory system** has several components.

Receptors that become activated by changes in the environment. The sensation magnitude is related to the number of receptors activated and longer the effect.

Non-painful stimuli cause **sensory adaptation**, we don't feel our socks

Whereas painful stimuli cause potentiation or sensitisation, pain gets worse as it goes on.

**Neurons** - The fundamental units of our brains that receive and transmit messages across our body are neurons. Neurons are composed of a single cell body that is responsible for the transmission of communication signals between cells and hundreds of shorter processes that come out of the cell body.

**Neuron Communication** One neuron communicates with other neurons or a muscle cell at a synapse. A typical neuron has a cell body, dendrites or branches, and an axon that carries electrical signals away from the neuron towards another neuron. Electrical signals carried by axons are called action potentials. The action potential is converted into a chemical message, which in turn interacts with the recipient neuron or effector. Surprisingly, neurons do not actually touch each other to communicate.

**Glial** - four functions To surround neurons and hold them in place. To supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons. To insulate one neuron from another. And to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons.

**Neuro Transmitters** There are many transmitters in the brain that chemically facilitate messages between neurons. Major two are glutamate and GABA. **Glutamate** is an excitatory neurotransmitter and acts as an accelerator. While **GABA**, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, acts like the brakes. Other important neurotransmitters found in the brain include **serotonin**, related depression. **Norepinephrine**, which is produced in the brain stem and travels to different parts of the brain. And **dopamine**, involved in reinforcing behavior and can also be involved in addiction. Dopamine is also key in motor modulation. A lack of dopamine, for example, is what is seen in Parkinson's disease. A lack of dopamine causes poverty of movement and a rigidity.

**Vision** specialized pathway - The visual pathway, starts in the retina in the eyes. The visual signal gets converted to an electrical signal and travels along the optic nerve, the chiasm, the optic tracts, the optic radiations to primary visual cortex in the occipital lobes all the way in the back of the brain. The visual cortex decodes into crude information a very pixelated picture. M**otor cortex** is in the most posterior part of the frontal lobe. Once this area activates, a neuron carries that information through the brain stem, spinal cord, all the way to the effector muscles being targeted. This signal is modulated by two loops, the basal ganglia and the cerebellar loop. These two loops control the precision speed etc making it smooth and purposeful.

Near the motor cortex is the speech area. The speech area is interesting because it has a sensory area and a motor area. From ears tosignal gets carried through a thick bundle of fibers to Broca's area. Broca's area is the motor center of speech. This moves your mouth in precise ways to speak. A lesion in these structures causes speech impairment.

I**nterior frontal area** is where your executive functions are located. This differentiates us from animals. That is where behavioral control, personality, emotions, thinking, and planning are housed. These circuits are involved in many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.

**Brain Stem** is thought to be the oldest part of the brain. In MaClean's triune of the brain, it represents the reptilian brain. This is also where respiration, heart rate, and other autonomic functions are controlled.

**Cerebellum**, or small brain in Latin, takes up only 10% volume in your brain, yet contains 80% of your brain's neurons. Traditionally, the cerebellum was thought of as a motor coordination structure, although recent studies show involvement in cognition as well. From a motor standpoint, the cerebellum acts as a comparator. It compares the movement detected from sensory feedback to the movement intended from the cortex and adjusts accordingly. We used to think that the brain was a static organ. It can be improved

## **Obesity Is Bad for the Brain. not that I Did not Know it**

Dr Ancel keys shared a report on fats vs heart disease. Some results turned out to be false in the minnesota coronary experiment.

**The study found that the more you drop the fat, the higher your likelihood of death from cardiovascular disease in particular, and all causes in general.**

African american diets - Fast-food, southern, plant-based, sweets, and alcohol. The one pattern that was consistently associated with higher mortality in strokes was the southern diet.

The southern diet was high in fried food, processed meats, and sweetened beverages, and low in fruits and vegetables. All this data caused the American Heart Association to change their longstanding recommendation of a low-fat diet to removing that recommendation altogether in 2015. The recommended amount of saturated fat remains at 10% or less however.

Increase in carbs was the problem that fat reducers faced in the Minnesota experiment. Insulin makes cells to take that glucose up and tells the fat stores to stop fatty acids since there is ready glucose to consume. It inhibits lipolysis. Asks the liver to stock up on the sugar in form of glycogen. Insulin fits in the lock or its receptor, this opens specialised channels for sugars to get in the cell. We thought insulin is at fault, but carbs just are having too much sugar that the cells are finding it difficult to cram in. The pancreases senses the sugar and pushes more insulin in to the body. The body now starts storing the carbs or sugar as fat since fat is more energy per gm. Fat cells do not multiple but grow bigger in size. They start depositing in other organs.

We call this fat deposition. Which causes fatty liver for example and can lead to liver failure if not rectified. Vessel constriction is now last and platelets rush in to solve the inflammation by the immune response. Plaque starts forming in the blood vessels. This is insulin resistance. This happens 10-20 years before diabetes.

It inhibits apoptosis or neuronal cell death, it plays a key role in the balance between long term potentiation and depression which are important mechanisms in learning and memory. It modulates inflammatory responses in the glial cells and it promotes dilation of blood vessels in the brain that causes enhanced cerebral profusion. Ultimately, insulin is a critical hormone in the brain.

Insulin resistance causes inflammation, interferes with cleanup of the brain waster and increases inflammation
Supplements and multi vitamins is not the same as eating vegetables and fruits
Intermittent fasting helps with improved brain functions

Exercise caused the neurons to become bushier.

Meditation increases grey matter, calms the body, reduces inflammatory markers
