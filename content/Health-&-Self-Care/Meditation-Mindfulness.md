# Meditation & Mindfullness

## Why Be Mindful?

**Looking for better**: We look for someplace else to stand, where we hope things will be better, happier, more the way we want them to be, or the way they used to be.

**Living in harmony** with oneself and with the world is examining who we are, questioning our view of the world and our place in it, and appreciating for the fullness of each moment we are alive.

**Reduce distraction**. It takes 8 days for the brain to settle for lower amount of activity. It allows mind to wander which increases

Allows us to see more clearly, and understand more deeply, areas in our lives that we were out of touch with or unwilling to look at. Helps appreciate feelings such as joy, peacefulness, and happiness which often go by fleetingly and unacknowledged

## What is Meditation?

Meditation means learning how to get out of this current, sit by its bank and listen to it, learn from it, and then use its energies to guide us rather than to pressurise us. This process doesn’t magically happen by itself. It takes energy

But meditation is not just about sitting, either. It is about stopping and being present, that is all

A good way to stop all the doing is to shift into the being mode for a moment. Think of yourself as an eternal witness, as timeless. Just watch this moment, without trying to change it at all. What is happening? What do you feel? What do you see? What do you hear?

## What is Stopping to Meditate?

In some ways, it’s as if you died and the world continued on. If you did die, all your responsibilities and obligations would immediately evaporate.

Maybe you don’t need to make one more phone call right now, even if you think you do. Maybe you don’t need to read something just now, or run one more errand.

By taking a few moments to die on purpose to the rush of time while you are still living, you free yourself to have time for the present. By dying now in this way, you actually become more alive now

Stopping, sitting down, and becoming aware of your breathing once in a while throughout the day. It can be for five minutes, or even five seconds. Go into full acceptance of the present moment, including how you are feeling and what you perceive to be happening. For these moments, don’t try to change anything at all, just breathe and let go.

When you’re ready, move in the direction your heart tells you to go, mindfully and with resolution.

## Why Meditate?

People want to meditate in order to relax, experience a special state, to become better, reduce some stress or pain, to break out of old habits and patterns, to become free or enlightened.

To go anywhere or develop ourselves in any way, we can only step from where we are standing.

In meditation practice, the best way to get somewhere is to let go of trying to get anywhere at all.

## Acceptance?

Remind yourself that acceptance of the present moment has nothing to do with resignation in the face of what is happening. It simply means a clear acknowledgment of what is happening

Remind yourself from time to time: **This is it.**

## Why Are We Unaware?

We tend to fall back into an automatic-pilot mode of unawareness. These lapses in awareness are frequently caused by an eddy of dissatisfaction with what we are seeing or feeling in that moment, out of which springs a desire for something to be different, for things to change

Am I awake?, Where is my mind right now?
What do we mean by being mindful?

It’s just a bare bones awareness of the breath moving in and the breath moving out

Abandon all ideas of getting somewhere or having anything happen. Just keep returning to the breath when the mind wanders, stringing moments of mindfulness together, breath by breath.

Calmness cannot be attained by misguided attempts to suppress the mind’s natural activity.

You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.

## What Meditation is Not. what is Non-doing?

Meditation is not about feeling a certain way. It’s about feeling the way you feel. It’s not about making the mind empty or still, although stillness does deepen in meditation and can be cultivated systematically. Above all, meditation is about letting the mind be as it is and knowing something about how it is in this moment.

If meditation doesn’t fulfil expectations, try again, now without expectations and just watching.

Not doing anything. Such moments of non-doing are the greatest gift one can give oneself.

Oh, I’ve had my moments, and if I had to do it over again, I’d have more of them. In fact, I’d try to have nothing else. Just moments, one after another, instead of living so many years ahead of each day.

The flavour and the sheer joy of non-doing are difficult for Americans to grasp because our culture places so much value on doing and on progress. Even our leisure tends to be busy and mindless. The joy of non-doing is that nothing else needs to happen for this moment to be complete. The wisdom in it, and the equanimity that comes out of it, lie in knowing that something else surely will.

Meditation is synonymous with the practice of non-doing. We aren’t practicing to make things perfect or to do things perfectly. Rather, we practice to grasp and realize (make real for ourselves) the fact that things already are perfect, perfectly what they are. This has everything to do with holding the present moment in its fullness without imposing anything extra on it, perceiving its purity and the freshness of its potential to give rise to the next moment.

## Patience

Patience is one of these fundamental ethical attitudes. If you cultivate patience, you almost can’t help cultivating mindfulness, and your meditation practice will gradually become richer and more mature. After all, if you really aren’t trying to get anywhere else in this moment, patience takes care of itself. It is a remembering that things unfold in their own time.

This doesn’t mean you can’t hurry when you have to. It is possible even to hurry patiently, mindfully, moving fast because you have chosen to.

Apparent lack of anger toward the Chinese. They have taken everything from us; should I let them take my mind as well?

We don’t have to let our anxieties and our desire for certain results dominate the quality of the moment, even when things are painful. When we have to push, we push. When we have to pull, we pull. But we know when not to push too, and when not to pull

## Letting Go

Letting go means just what it says. It’s an invitation to cease clinging to anything—whether it be an idea, a thing, an event, a particular time, or view, or desire. It is a conscious decision to release with full acceptance into the stream of present moments as they are unfolding. To let go means to give up coercing, resisting in exchange for something more powerful which comes out of allowing things to be as they are without getting caught up in your attraction to or rejection of them. It’s akin to letting your palm open to unhand something you have been holding on to.

## Cultivating Generosity

Generosity - Give more than you think you can, trusting that you are richer than you think. Celebrate this richness. Give as if you had inexhaustible wealth. This is called kingly giving.

Noticing the resistance to the impulse to give, the worries about the future, the feeling that you may be giving too much, or the thought that it won’t be appreciated enough, or that you will be exhausted from the effort, or that you won’t get anything out of it, or that you don’t have enough yourself. Consider the possibility that none of these are actually true, but that they are just forms of inertia, constriction, and fear-based self-protection.

Perhaps most of all, you need to give to yourself first for a while. Then you might try giving others a tiny bit more than you think you can, consciously noting and letting go of any ideas of getting anything in return.

**Initiate giving**. Don’t wait for someone to ask. See what happens—especially to you. You may find that you gain a greater clarity about yourself and about your relationships, as well as more energy rather than less. You may find that, rather than exhausting yourself or your resources, you will replenish them. Such is the power of mindful, selfless generosity. At the deepest level, there is no giver, no gift, and no recipient…only the universe rearranging itself.

The impulse frequently arises in me to squeeze another this or another that into this moment. Just this phone call, just stopping off here on my way there. Never mind that it might be in the opposite direction.

## Voluntary Simplicity - Slowing down

Voluntary simplicity means going fewer places in one day rather than more, seeing less so I can see more, doing less so I can do more, acquiring less so I can have more. It all ties in.

Slowing everything down is a big part of this. Telling my mind and body to stay put rather than answering the phone, not call someone who needs calling right in that moment, choosing not to acquire new things on impulse. Others are maybe just to sit for an evening and do nothing, or to read a book, or go for a walk alone, look at the moon, or feel the air on my face under the trees, or go to sleep early.
I practice saying no to keep my life simple, and I find I never do it enough. It’s an arduous discipline all its own, and well worth the effort. Yet it is also tricky. There are needs and opportunities to which one must respond. A commitment to simplicity in the midst of the world is a delicate balancing act

## Ask Yourself why You want to Meditate?

Asking yourself why you meditate or why you want to meditate. Don’t believe your first answers. Just write down a list of whatever comes to mind. Continue asking yourself. Also, inquire about your values, about what you honor most in life. Make a list of what is really important to you. Ask yourself: What is my vision, my map for where I am and where I am going? Does this vision reflect my true values and intentions? Am I remembering to embody those values? Do I practice my intentions? How am I now in my job, in my family, in my relationships, with myself? How do I want to be? How might I live my vision, my values? How do I relate to suffering, both my own and others?

## Sitting with Dignity

The next time you feel a sense of dissatisfaction, of something being missing or not quite right, turn inward just as an experiment. See if you can capture the energy of that very moment. Instead of picking up a magazine or going to the movies, calling a friend or looking for something to eat or acting up in one way or another, make a place for yourself. Sit down and enter into your breathing, if only for a few minutes. Don’t look for anything—neither flowers nor light nor a beautiful view. Don’t extol the virtues of anything or condemn the inadequacy of anything. Don’t even think to yourself, I am going inward now. Just sit. Reside at the centre of the world. Let things be as they are.

Sit down and watch the moments unfold, with no agenda other than to be fully present

Keep the posture erect but not stiff. Think of yourself as a mountain.

Everybody seems to instantly know that inner feeling of dignity and how to embody it

Five minutes of formal practice can be as profound or more so than forty-five minutes. The sincerity of your effort matters far more than elapsed time, since we are really talking about stepping out of minutes and hours and into moments, which are truly dimensionless and therefore infinite

Keeping this mountain image in mind as you sit in formal meditation. Explore its usefulness in deepening your capacity to dwell in stillness; to sit for longer periods of time; to sit in the face of adversity, difficulties, and storms or drabness in the mind. Ask yourself what you are learning from your experiments with this practice. Can you see some subtle transformation occurring in your attitude toward things that change in your life? Can you carry the mountain image with you in daily life? Can you see the mountain in others, and allow them their own shape and form, each mountain uniquely itself?

## Awareness & Appreciation

Bringing awareness to walking, wherever you find yourself. Slow it down a bit. Center yourself in your body and in the present moment. Appreciate the fact that you are able to walk, which many people cannot. Perceive how miraculous it is, and for a moment, don’t take for granted that your body works so wonderfully. Walk with dignity and confidence. Walk in beauty, wherever you are.
Try walking formally as well. Keep a continuity of mindfulness between the walking and the sitting. Ten minutes is good, or half an hour. Remember once again that it is not clock time we are concerned with here. But you will learn more and understand walking meditation more deeply if you challenge yourself to keep at it past your first or second impulse to stop.

Noticing the difference in how you feel and how you handle stress in periods when you are into the discipline of daily meditation and yoga practice and in periods of your life when you are not. See if you can become aware of the consequences of your more mindless and automatic behaviours, especially when they are provoked by pressures stemming from work or home life.

## Maitri

Maitri on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB)
Invite sense of kindness and acceptance and cherishing to arise in your own heart? You would have to do so over and over again. The mind won’t take easily to it, because the wounds we carry run deep. But you might try, just as an experiment, to hold yourself in awareness and acceptance for a time in your practice, as a mother would hold a hurt or frightened child, with a completely available and unconditional love. Can you cultivate forgiveness of yourself, if not of others? Is it even possible to invite yourself to be happy in this moment? Is it okay for you to feel okay? Is the basis of happiness present in this moment at all?

Touching base with feelings of loving kindness within yourself at some point in your meditation practice. See if you can get behind any objections you may have to this practice, or behind your reasons for being unlovable or unacceptable. Just look at all that as thinking. Experiment with allowing yourself to bathe in the warmth and acceptance of loving kindness as if you were a child held in a loving mother’s or father’s arms. Then play with directing it toward others and out into the world

We submit ourselves to constant bombardment by sounds and images that come from minds other than our own, that fill our heads with information and trivia, other people’s adventures and excitement and desires. Watching television leaves even less room in the day for experiencing stillness. It soaks up time, space, and silence, a soporific, lulling us into mindless passivity. Bubble gum for the eyes,

**Harmony** - There is order, and within it, embedded disorder, yet that too is orderly.

**Waking early** has the added value of giving you a very real head start on the day. If you can begin your day with a firm foundation in mindfulness and inner peacefulness.

Make it a time for intentional wakefulness. You don’t want to fill this time with anything other than awareness. No need to go over the day’s commitments in your head and live ahead of yourself. This is a time of no-time, of stillness, of presence, of being with yourself.

## Being Present

Try being present for things like taking a shower, or eating. When you are in the shower, are you really in the shower?

Ordinary men hate solitude.
But the Master makes use of it,
Embracing his aloneness, realizing
He is one with the whole universe.

**Anger** - I am too upset in this moment about being manipulated, who was supposed to be ready at a certain time and isn’t, to fully appreciate my daughter’s problem here.
I am caught up in an eddy of self-righteous indignation. My I does not want to be kept waiting, to be taken advantage of. Inwardly fuming, for what turns out to be a remarkably short time.

The matter dissolved. But not in my memory, which still carries, and I hope always will, that look on my daughter’s face that I was unable to read quickly enough to be fully present for. Had I been able to, the anger would have died then and there. There is a price we pay for being attached to a narrow view of being right. My passing mood state is far less important than her trust. But in that moment, her trust got trampled all the same. Without care and awareness, small-minded feeling states can dominate the moment. It happens all the time. The collective pain we cause others and ourselves bleeds our souls. Hard as it is for us to admit, especially about ourselves, self-tinged anger may be something we indulge in and surrender to far too often. I observe the anger as it starts rising in me. It turns out that it is preceded by a mild feeling of revulsion. Then I notice the stirrings of a feeling of betrayal which is not so mild. Someone in my family didn’t respect my request, and I am taking it very personally. After all, my feelings count in the family, don’t they.

Observe the ways in which your feelings are creations of your mind’s view of things, and that maybe that view is not complete. Can you allow this state of affairs to be okay and neither make yourself right or wrong? Can you be patient enough and courageous enough to explore putting stronger and stronger emotions into the pot and just holding them and letting them cook.

## Self Inflation

Then you might go around thinking, maybe even saying, that you have gotten somewhere, that the meditation practice works. The ego wants to lay claim and take credit for this special feeling or understanding, whatever it is. As soon as this happens, you are no longer into meditation but into advertising. It is easy to get caught here, using meditation practice to support the self-inflation habit

Whenever you find yourself thinking you are getting somewhere or that you’re not getting where you are supposed to be, it can be helpful to ask yourself things like: Where am I supposed to get? Who is supposed to get somewhere? Why are some mind states less valid to observe and accept as being present than others? Am I inviting mindfulness into each moment, or indulging in mindless repetition of the forms of meditation practice, mistaking the form for the essence of it? Am I using meditation as a technique?

## Experiences

Look at a sunset. Thinking comes in and perhaps you find yourself saying something to a companion, either about the sunset and how beautiful it is or about something else that it reminded you of. In speaking, you disturb the direct experiencing of the moment. You have been drawn away from the sun and sky and the light. You have been captured by your own thought and by your impulse to voice it. Your comment breaks the silence. Or even if you don’t say anything, the thought or memory that came up had already carried you away to some degree from the actual sunset in that moment. So now you are really enjoying the sunset in your head rather than the sunset that is actually happening. You may be thinking you are enjoying the sunset itself, but actually you are only experiencing it through the veil of your embellishments with past sunsets and other memories and ideas that this one triggered in you
If you habitually run through your moments without being fully in them, you may miss some of the most precious experiences of your life, such as connecting with the people you love, or with sunsets or the crisp morning air.
Why? Because you were too busy and your mind too encumbered with what you thought was important in that moment to take the time to stop, to listen, to notice things. Perhaps you were going too fast to slow down, too fast to know the importance of making eye contact, of touching, of being in your body. When we are functioning in this mode, we may eat without really tasting, see without really seeing, hear without really hearing, touch without really feeling, and talk without really knowing what we are saying.

**Eat a raisin only after the one in the mouth has finished.**

## Stress

It is not so much the stressors in our lives but how we see them and what we do with them, how we are in relationship to them, that determines how much we are at their mercy. If we can change the way we see, we can change.

## Busyness

Filling up your time with busyness is another self-destructive avoidance behaviour. Instead of facing up to your problems, you can run around like crazy doing good things until your life is overflowing with commitments and obligations and you can’t possibly make time for yourself. Despite all the running around, you may not really know what you are doing.

## Breaking Free

The very first and most important step in breaking free from a lifetime of stress reactivity is to be aware of what is actually happening while it is happening.
Once you are an integral part of the whole situation, simply by holding whatever is happening in awareness, you are actually changing the matrix of the entire situation even before you do anything overt, such as take action, or even open your mouth to speak. This interior shift to embrace what is unfolding in awareness in the present moment can be extremely important, precisely because it gives you a range of options for possibly influencing what will happen next. Bringing awareness to such a moment takes only a split second, but it can make a critical difference in the outcome of a stressful encounter. In fact, it is the deciding factor in whether you go down the path of the Stress Reaction
Let’s examine how you would do this. If you manage to remain centered in that moment of stress and recognise both the stressfulness of the situation and your impulses to react, you have already introduced a new dimension into the situation. Because of this, you neither have to react automatically with your usual habitual patterns of emotional expression, whatever they are, nor do you have to suppress all your thoughts and feelings associated with heightened arousal to prevent yourself from going out of control. You can actually allow yourself to feel threatened, fearful, angry, or hurt and to feel the tension in your body in these moments. Being conscious in the present, you can easily recognise and identify these agitations and contractions for what they are: thoughts, emotions, and sensations.

Saying to yourself, This is it or Here is a stressful situation or Now is a time to tune in to my breathing and centre myself. Mindfulness sets the stage for you to respond appropriately right here in this very moment. If you are quick enough, you can sometimes catch the stress reaction before it develops completely and turn it into a more imaginative and creative response instead.
It takes practice to catch stress reactions as they are emerging.

## Feelings

The intentional knowing of your feelings in times of emotional suffering contains in itself the seeds of healing. Just as we saw with physical pain, that aspect of you that can know your feelings, that sees clearly what they are, that can accept them in the present, while they are happening, no matter what they are, in their full, undisguised fury if such is the case, or in their many disguises, such as confusion, rigidity, or alienation, that awareness itself has an independent perspective that is outside of your suffering. It is not buffeted by the storms of the heart and of the mind. The storms still have to run their course; their pain has to be felt. But they actually unfold differently when cradled in awareness

Does everything have to be perfect right now, or under my total control right now, for me to be happy?
Alternatively, you might ask yourself, Is

From a systems perspective, there are two major interacting components to emotional pain. One is the domain of your feelings; the other is the domain of the situation or problem that lies at the root of the feelings. In being with your hurt, you might ask yourself whether you can see your emotional state as separate from the details of what has actually happened or is happening. If you can differentiate between these two common
By acting mindfully when you can, whether it results in doing or non-doing, you are putting the past behind you. As you act in the present, things change in response to what you choose to do, and this in turn will affect the problem itself. This way of proceeding is sometimes called problem-focused coping
**Practice not-doing and everything will fall into place**

## Time Stress

The answer is simple and not at all far-fetched: well-being, inner balance, and peacefulness exist outside time. If you commit yourself to spending some time each day in inner stillness, even if it is for two minutes, or five, or ten, for those moments you are stepping out of the flow of time altogether. The stillness and calm, the sense of well-being and wakeful presence that come from letting go of time transform your experience of time when you move back into it. Then, simply by bringing awareness to present-moment experience, it becomes possible to flow along with time during your day rather than constantly fighting against it or feeling driven by it.

So if you are pressed for time, being in the present gives you more time by giving you back the fullness of each moment that you already have. No matter what is happening, you can be centered in perceiving and accepting things as they are. Of course, you can also be aware of what still needs to be done in the future, without it causing you undue anxiety or loss of perspective.

First by being in your body as you use your devices, and thus being in the present moment. Second, you can construct texts mindfully, with full awareness of what you are doing. If you are responding to tons of email, you can pace yourself so you are not feeling like you are playing Whac-A-Mole and running faster and faster to respond, even as you fall further and further behind. You are only falling behind in your own mind, especially if you lose touch with who is doing all the doing, namely, with who you are, and the whole domain of being.

We do this stuff just because we can. But do we ever stop and ask ourselves, even for one moment or one breath, what might be lost in this process of documenting and sharing so quickly?

The first is to remind yourself that time is a product of thought. Minutes and hours are conventions, agreed upon so that we can conveniently meet and communicate and work in harmony. But they have no absolute meaning,

A second way of freeing yourself from the tyranny of time is to live in the present more of the time. We waste enormous amounts of time and energy musing about the past and worrying about the future. These moments are hardly ever satisfying. Usually they produce anxiety and time urgency, thoughts such as Time is running out or Those were the good old days
The essence of mindfulness in daily life is to make every moment you have your own. Even if you are hurrying, which is sometimes necessary, then at least hurry mindfully. Be aware of your breathing, of the need to move face

Third way of freeing yourself from the tyranny of time is devote some of it intentionally each day just to be, in other words, to meditate.
Fourth way of freeing yourself from time is to simplify your life in certain ways.

## Simplifying

This is basically [Essentialism](Living/Essentialism.md)
Simplifying may mean prioritising the things that you have to and want to do and, at the same time, consciously choosing to give certain things up. It may mean learning to say no sometimes, even to things you want to do or to people you care about and want to help, so that you are protecting and preserving some space for silence, for non-doing—and for everything you have already said yes previously.
