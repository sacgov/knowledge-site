# Science of Exercise

**Homeostasis** : Tendency of the body to maintain a stable environment for cells by narrowly

Regulating critical variables, pH, O2, glucose and temperature.

Exercise is a very powerful disruptor of homeostasis. Glucose must be maintained. Acid level increases and temperature raises

To ensure proper amount of oxygen and nutrition is delivered to the working muscles heart must pump more forcefully, blood vessels must dilate to allow enough flow

Heart rate increases. Circulating hormones cause dilation of vessels and redirection from stomach to working muscles by the brain

**Overloading** habitually overloading a system will respond and adapt

Stress → acute response → chronic response (3-5 times a week for 6 months)

Classic example is increased mitochondrial number.

**Specificity -** Benchpress only works on chest and only that muscle is activated

**Reversibility -** 6 weeks can have a has reduction in mitochondrial creations and a gradual reduction in VOT max

**Individuality** - Response to exercise is very genetic
