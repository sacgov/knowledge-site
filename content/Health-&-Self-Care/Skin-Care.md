My goal is healthy skin with minimal wrinkles, with a slight glow.
Being acne free is a pre-requisite to this endeavour.
I do have slight acne scars that i wish to heal.

# What I Do Currently

Cleanse my face thrice a day, ideally baking it into a daily routine.
Apply moisturiser and vitamin C serum. [Order](Health-&-Self-Care/Skin-Care.md#Order%20of%20application%20) matters.
Apply sunscreen while going out regardless of weather
Wear sunglasses and possibly a [Balaclava](https://www.amazon.in/balaclava/s?k=balaclava) while riding my bike.
Apply an under eye ointment weekly.
TODO - Apply a face pack once a month. Seemed to me like an overkill (till jun 2023). Most people do it.

# Nutrition

Nutrition is paramount in improving any part of our body and skin is not exception.

# Order of Application

Skin works to keep things out. We want the ingredients in skin care products we use to to get in. Small amount of ingredients manage to get in.
