# Bada Hua Toh Kya Hua - Kabir

## Hindi

बड़ा हुआ तो क्या हुआ, जैसे पेड़ खजूर ।
पंथी को छाया नहीं, फल लागे अति दूर ।।

## English Transliteration

Bada hua to kya hua, jaise ped khajur
Panthi ko chhaya nahi, fal lage ati dur.

## Meaning

Date palm tree looks very big and tall, but neither can it provide shade because of it structure of branches nor fruit which is high up the tree. Similarly, if you are rich or from a prosperous family but are unable to do good to anyone, then there is no use in growing up like this.
