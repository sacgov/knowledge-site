# We Are the Champions

We are the champions By the band Queen.
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTYJryNgLH8)

I've paid my dues
Time after time I've done my sentence
But committed no crime And
bad mistakes I've made a few
I've had my share of sand Kicked in my face
But I've come through
And we mean to go
on and on and on and on
We are the champions,
my friends And we'll keep on fighting till the end
