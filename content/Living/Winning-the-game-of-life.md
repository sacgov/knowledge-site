# The Game of Life

Notes from by [Link](https://oliveremberton.com/2014/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide/) , Mark Manson and [SlateStarCodex](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/s0bk4a/how_to_be_in_peace_with_the_inherent_unfairness/)

## My Goal

My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humour, and some style.

Always Remember that
**If you do not play, you do not win.**

## The Games

There are some fun mini-games – like dancing, driving, running, and sex. –

People want an amazing physique. But you don’t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions.

People want a partner, a spouse. But you don’t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It’s part of the game of love. You can’t win if you don’t play

## How to Win

The key to winning is simply managing your resources.

**Top priority should always be mastering where your time goes.**
Many players find that when they choose to do something – say “go to the gym” – their body ignores them completely.

This is not a bug. Everybody has a state, which you can’t see directly, but looks something like this

If your state gets too low in one area, _your body will disobey your own instructions until your needs are met_

1. **Keep your state high.** If you’re hungry, exhausted, or utterly deprived of fun, your willpower will collapse. Ensure you take consistently good care of yourself.
2. **Don’t demand too much willpower from one day.** Spread your most demanding tasks over multiple days, and mix them in with less demanding ones.
3. **Attempt the most important tasks first.** This makes other tasks more difficult, but makes your top task more likely.
4. **Reduce the need to use willpower by reducing choices.** If you’re trying to work on a computer that can access Facebook, you’ll need more willpower because you’re constantly choosing the hard task over the easy one. Eliminate such distractions.

You need to put time into things that ensure a healthy state – like food and sleep – to keep your willpower high. Then you need to develop your skills with what you have left.

Some Endeavours lead to a lot of opportunities and others lead to dead ends.

Some skills are more valuable than others. Good ones can open up whole paths like a tech tree. Others are dead ends like **juggling**

It’s very hard to max out one skill to be the best – in fact, that’s often impossible. It’s easier to get pretty decent at lots of related skills that amount to something bigger

This should decide the direction of efforts

## Where You Live

Environment has a great impact on your stats, skills, and your chances of levelling up.

It’s possible to play the game well almost anywhere, but it’s a lot easier in certain places. The odds of being born in an optimal location are virtually zero, research your options, and consider moving early. Location is a multiplier to all skills and states.

## Finding a Partner

80% of finding someone comes down to being your most attractive self, which – like so much in life – just means _putting your time in the right places_ If you’re exercising, socialising, well nourished and growing in your career, you will radiate attraction automatically. The remaining 20% is simply putting yourself in places where you can meet the right people.

# Unfairness of the Game

**The world owes us nothing. It was here first.**

Unless you’re winning, most of life will seem hideously unfair to you. The truth is, life is just playing by different rules.

The real rules are there. They actually make sense. But they’re a bit more complicated, and a lot less comfortable

## Rules of the World

![reward-assumed](assets/reward-02.png)
![Reward-ACtual](assets/reward-01.png)

### Rule #1 : Life is a Competition

That Girlfriend / High-paying job / Nobel Prize that you want? So does someone else Most achievements are only notable relative to others.

People dress up to win partners. They interview to win jobs. If you deny that competition exists, you’re just losing. Everything in demand is on a competitive scale.

> The best is reserved to those who are willing to truly fight for it.

### **Rule #2 You’re Judged by what You Do, not what You think**

Society judges people on what you can do for others. “I’m a good person”. “I’m ambitious”. “I’m better than this.” These idle impulses may comfort us at night, but they’re not how the world sees us. They’re not even how we see other people.

A cancer researcher is rewarded less than a supermodel. Why? Because those abilities are rarer and impact more people

### Rule #3 . Our Idea of Fairness is Self Interest

Reality is indifferent. You studied hard, but you failed the exam. You worked hard, but you didn’t get promoted. You love her, but she won’t return your calls.
[](Improving-Thinking/Thinking-Clearly.md#What%20is%20Reality%20-%20Being%20Hyper%20Realistic?)

Take a proper look at that person you fancy but didn’t fancy you back. That’s a complete person. A person with years of experience being someone completely different to you. A real person who interacts with hundreds or thousands of other people every year. Now what are the odds that among all that, you’re automatically their first pick for love-of-their-life? Because what - you exist? Because you feel something for them? That might matter to you, but their decision is not about you.

Maybe someone has different priorities to you – like, say, long term growth over short term happiness. Our idea of fairness isn’t actually obtainable. It’s really just a cloak for wishful thinking. Facing that reality might just be the key to unlocking your understanding of the world, and with it, all of your potential.

**Some people are smart, beautiful, rich, talented. Others aren't. You're part of the latter.**
[Acceptance](Mental-Wellness/Acceptance.md) helps.

## Finding Solace in Unfairness

You know, I used to think it was awful that life was so unfair. Wouldn't it be much worse if life were fair, and all the terrible things that happen to us come because we actually deserve them? So, now I take great comfort in the general hostility and unfairness of the universe.

The Jews also talk about how God judges you for your gifts. Rabbi Zusya once said that when he died, he wasn’t worried that God would ask him “Why weren’t you Moses?” or “Why weren’t you Solomon?” But he did worry that God might ask “Why weren’t you Rabbi Zusya?”

This is why it’s important for me to believe in innate ability, and especially differences in innate ability. If everything comes down to hard work and positive attitude, then God has every right to ask me “Why weren’t you Srinivasa Ramanujan?” or “Why weren’t you Elon Musk?”

If everyone is legitimately a different person with a different brain and different talents and abilities, then all God gets to ask me is whether or not I was Sachin Govind.

This seems like a gratifyingly low bar. See also [How-to-measure-Life](Living/How-to-measure-Life.md).

# Coping Mechanisms

Coping Mechanisms i found not worthy of pursing. We need to get rid of these coping mechanisms as soon as possible.

## **The World Doesn't Owe You X**

Indeed. But how is that realisation helpful? I couldn't stop caring about X. I feel like it _does_ owe myself X, through my hard work. I succumb to the just-world fallacy, only to realise that is not the way the world works.

## **Reducing standards**

Then I have to make the pick between the two options: (a) the agony of "settling down" for X (say, not a six-figure job but a $60 k job), but then I feel secretly jaded. "Why, _why_ should I settle for something that I wouldn't be at peace with, even after putting _so much_ effort?" (b) not reducing my standards, but then never achieving X. Then I feel like missing out.

## Detachment, and Stop Caring about X Altogether

This is probably the Buddhist way of seeing things, I find this viewpoint to be pretty sad. To me, what makes life worth living is the things that you look forward to. If you have nothing to look forward to, and you care about nothing, I don't see the joy in living an ascetic lifestyle, devoid of any surprises.

## **Stop Comparing Your Behind-the-scenes with Everyone's Highlight Reel**

Arguing that there are downsides to "achieving" X, so not having X is fine too. That seems like a toxic and dishonest coping strategy to me. Poverty < beverly hills at any time.

Being alone and feeling like losing in the game of life is a slow motion human tragedy on par with homelessness.
Winning is game of life is mainly about having a sense of belonging, feeling important.

**Deserve’s got nothing to do with it**.

What can i do if i should not cope. Be reposible.

# Assuming Responsibility

We have no control over where you were born, your biological sex, how rich or poor your family is, what colour your skin is, how tall you are, etc. These things do matter and they will obviously impact your life in major ways.

**While you may not be to blame for your situation, you are always responsible for your situation.**

Take time but not a lot of time off. Schedule breaks. Enjoy life. Do not follow social media.

## Taking Action Blindly

**Have a Bias for action**. See the world for what it is and not what we wish it to be.

[William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James) made an agreement with himself. In his diary, he wrote that he would try an experiment. He would spend one entire year believing that he was 100% responsible for everything that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the outcome.

Then it will be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him. And then he would take his own life.

We are responsible for experiences that aren’t our fault all the time.

In the end, James turned around his life. He is the Father of American psychology.

Actions effect our emotions. Actions give us hope.

# What if I Fail

You learn what caused you to fail. Unlike Video Games you can always try again.

**The window of opportunity to change our life exists as long as we are healthy.**

People eventually come to feel a greater sense of appreciation in life, their priorities change, their relationships are warmer and more compassionate, they’re more emotionally intelligent, they draw from a greater source of personal strength, and they see new possibilities in their lives they never even considered before.
