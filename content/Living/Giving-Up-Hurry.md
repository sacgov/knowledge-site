# Giving up Hurry

We should form a clear intention to live without hurry. One day at a time. Trying today.
Do not play catch up with life all your life. Live it just a little. Resign from being productive every extra hour we gain.

Take a sabbatical. Slow is bad and sluggish. Fast is good and sexy. This is a narrative sold to us. We are pathologically busy and not actually productive anyways.

A century ago the less you worked, the more status you had. Now it’s flipped: the more you sit around and relax, the less status you have.

Get your attention back. Get out of partial attention. Our willpower doesn’t stand a chance against the Like button.

## Addiction

Addiction is the relentless pull to a substance or an activity that becomes so compulsive it ultimately interferes with everyday life. By that definition, nearly everyone I know is addicted in some measure to the Internet

## Hurry Sickness

A behaviour pattern characterised by continual rushing and anxiousness.

A malaise in which a person feels chronically short of time, and so tends to perform every task faster and to get flustered when encountering any kind of delay.

A continuous struggle and unremitting attempt to accomplish or achieve more and more things or participate in more and more events in less and less time

## Restlessness

When you actually do try to slow down and rest, you can’t relax. You go to bed early but toss and turn with anxiety. You watch TV but simultaneously check your phone, fold laundry, and get into a spat on Twitter (okay, maybe you just answer an email). Workaholism (or just nonstop activity)—You just don’t know when to stop. Or worse, you can’t stop. Another hour, another day, another week. Your drugs of choice are accomplishment and accumulation. Emotional numbness : You just don’t have the capacity to feel another’s pain. Or your own pain.

Lack of care for your body—You don’t have time for the basics: eight hours of sleep a night; daily exercise; healthy, home-cooked food; minimal stimulants; margin. You gain weight. Get sick multiple times a year. Regularly wake up tired. Don’t sleep well. Live off the four horsemen of the industrialized food apocalypse: caffeine, sugar, processed carbs, and alcohol. Escapist behaviors— When we’re too tired to do what’s actually life giving for our souls, we each turn to our distraction of choice: overeating, overdrinking, binge-watching Netflix, browsing social media, surfing the web, looking at porn—name your preferred cultural narcotic.

Hurry kills relationships. Love takes time; hurry doesn’t have it.

We’re running to something—promotions or purchases or experiences or stamps on our passports or the next high—searching in vain for something no earthly experience has on offer: a sense of self-worth and love and acceptance

The solution is not more time

We spend hour binging rather than to sleep which is the best thing ever we can do.

Embrace boredom. Wait with nothing to do at many times. Be mindful. Desire is a great motivator. It’s the engine of our lives; its function is to propel us out of bed and out into the world.

The Sabbath is simply a day to stop: stop working, stop wanting, stop worrying, just stop

Things aren’t just things; they are identities.

The drive to possess is an engine for hurry
But when you run your cost-benefit analysis, don’t forget to calculate: you’re paying for that experience not only in cash but also in time
Remove any thing that does not spark joy.
Never impulse buy. When you do buy, opt for fewer, better things.
When you can, share.
Get into the habit of giving things away
Cultivate a deep appreciation for the simple pleasures
Lead a cheerful, happy revolt against the spirit of materialism
Take up journaling

# How to Relax

Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are
No longer tolerate the habits causing me worry.
