# Personal Renewal

Notes from the essay [Personal Renewal by John Gardner](https://fs.blog/great-talks/personal-renewal-john-gardner/)

I want to help you think about yourselves.

One must be compassionate in assessing the reasons for folly.

You've known such people — feeling secretly defeated, maybe somewhat sour and cynical, or perhaps just vaguely dispirited. Or maybe they just ran so hard for so long that somewhere along the line they forgot what it was they were running for.

**We can't all get to the top, and that isn't the point of life anyway**

How many people whom you know well — people even younger than yourselves –are already trapped in fixed attitudes and habits. Their clocks have stopped ticking at a certain point of time

## Forgiving the past

Don't be too hard on yourself. Be self forgiving. Let the inner voice be like a coach

And above all don't imagine that the story is over. Life has a lot of chapters.

A person on self-renewal will have to deal with ghosts of the past — the memory of earlier failures, the remnants of childhood dramas and rebellions, accumulated grievances and resentments, cages the society and parents have drawn that have long outlived their cause.

Everyone has to figure to get beat some time.

**Did you collaborate in your own defeat? A lot of people do. Learn not to**.

You never conquer the mountain, You only conquer yourself.

## Life-long Learning

It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.
Learn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes.
We learn by growing older, by suffering, by loving, **by bearing with the things we can't change**, by taking risks.

The things you learn in maturity aren't simple ones such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behaviour, not to burn energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions, if you have any, which you do. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent, but pays off on character.

You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing.

**There are some things you can't learn from others. You have to pass through the fire.**

As a rule you have to pick up some mileage and dents in your fenders before you really understand.

**You come to terms with yourself. At the end of every road you meet yourself.**

Capacities you actually develop to the full, bloom as the result of an interplay between you and life's challenges

## Life is Suffering

**Life is a vale of tears, for no one is it free of pain**

See our suffering in the framework of all human suffering, to accept the gifts of life with thanks and endure life's indignities with dignity.

Your identity is what you've committed yourself to. It maybe is doing a better job at work.

Life is tumultuous — an endless losing and regaining of balance, a continuous struggle, never an assured victory. Be the man in the arena

**Nothing is ever finally safe. Every important battle is fought and re-fought**. We need to develop a resilient, indomitable morale that enables us to face those realities and still strive with every ounce of energy to prevail. You may wonder if such a struggle — endless and of uncertain outcome — isn't more than humans can bear. But all of history suggests that the human spirit is well fitted to cope with just that kind of world.

**The door of opportunity doesn't really close as long as you're reasonably healthy.**

## Meaning

Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.
