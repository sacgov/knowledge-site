We optimise of profitability. The way we do it i looking at more tangible ones that can happen tomorrow over what can happen over 10 years

When we have extra 10 mins or 30 mins. We work on what makes us feel more achieved.
Our careers provide the most tangible achievements
Humans have to aggregate and measure success because of our limited minds with money or how high a person in an org’s hierarchy

But god with an infinite mind does not have to do that
At the end of this life when we have an interview with god he is going to ask us.
I have given you these talents, Have you put them to good use
I put you in this situation with person, did you bless them with your presence
Did you make people’s life better.
