# Designing Life

Summary from [TED Talk](./$2./$2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SemHh0n19LA)

## Wrong Questions

1. What is your passion?
2. You should know where you want to go
3. Be the best are you settling
4. Connect the dots . What we do - what you believe - who you are

## Steps

1. Prototyping - What simple step can i take - What can i do in the next 2 weeks. No need to ever figure out all the life.
2. Ask interesting questions on the problem at hand
3. Expose assumptions
4. Involve others in your ideas
5. Sneak up on the future. Think of the results.
6. Take decisions that can not be reversed

### Problems in Designing a Solution

Problem 1

Believing that there is only one solution. I should have already known it. Also maybe i am late. All of these are untrue.

Problem 2

Choosing a circumstance as a problem. Like my height or money of a musician. There is no solving it. Harbor only [Is My Thought Helpful?](Habits-Behaviour/ACT-Acceptance-Therapy.md#Is%20My%20Thought%20Helpful?)

If i was a musician who is going broke, My reasoning should be the following.
Since i am not going to make money using music what can i do to sustain or what kind of living can i adopt.
Since i cannot improve my height, Can i improve my weight to improve my appearance. Once i am fit enough and it would be difficult to become further fitter, I need to work on grooming. Prototype what is possible. This is the heart of design thinking.
