# How to Get Rich

1. Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
2. Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.
3. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
4. You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.
5. You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
6. Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.
7. The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.
8. Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
9. Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.
10. Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
11. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
12. Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.
13. Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.
14. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
15. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
16. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.
17. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
18. Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
19. “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”
20. —Archimedes
21. Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
22. Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.
23. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.
24. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
25. Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
26. An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
27. If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.
28. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.
29. Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.
30. There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.
31. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.
32. Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
33. You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.
34. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.
35. Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
36. Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.
37. There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.
38. Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.
39. When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realise it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.
40. Summary: Productise Yourself

PS: You’ll never be rich since you’re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that’s just good enough

# Building Knowledge

1. Everything in life compounds. Play long term games
2. Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.
3. If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Keep looking.
4. Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is “hot” right now.
5. If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it
6. Build products with no marginal cost of replication.
7. You’re never going to get rich renting out your time.
8. Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
9. Earn with your mind, not your time.
10. Stay out of total catastrophic loss. Avoiding ruin
11. Don’t gamble everything on one go. Instead, take rationally optimistic bets with big upsides
12. Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard.
13. All the people you dated until you met your husband or wife. It was wasted time in the goal sense. Not wasted in the exponential sense, not wasted in the learning sense, but definitely wasted in the goal sense
14. Drop something that does not help us in the long run. The relationship not leading to marriage or a job that i would eventually leave. If armed with this information now, drop it
15. Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
16. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media
17. People will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high-integrity effort.
18. I will never be worth than i think i am worth
19. Factor time into every decision
20. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you
21. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

# Choosing to Build Ourselves

1. If you’re going to live in a city for ten years, a job for five years, a relationship for a decade, you should be spending one to two years deciding these things. These are highly dominating decisions. Those three decisions really matter.
2. You have to say no to everything and free up your time so you can solve the important problems
3. What are one or two steps you’d take to surround yourself with successful people?
4. Eliminate should’s from my life.
5. To have peace of mind, you have to have peace of body first.
6. Impatience with actions, patience with results.
7. First, you know it. Then, you understand it. Then, you can explain it. Then, you can feel it. Finally, you are it.
8. Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.
9. Walking meetings.
10. When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you.
11. When playing, surround yourself with people happier than us.
