**Acknowledge that regret only exists with hindsight**

# Foundation Regrets

“If only I had done the work.” A lot of finance and health-related regrets are in this category.

The lesson: Think ahead. Do the work. Start now.

# Inaction Regrets

Over time, humans are much more likely to regret inaction – the chances they didn’t take. This is partly due to having a larger list of things we did not do over the decade and we tend to remember very little of the things that we did do. Moreover moral code stops us from doing most things that we'd regret. Those opportunities to start a business, chase a true love or something less grand, like learning a new language or how to play an instrument. They leave you thinking, “If only I had taken that chance.” Inaction regrets outnumbered action regrets in Pink’s survey by two to one.

The lesson: Ask him/her out. Take the trip. Start the business. Speak up.

# Connection Regrets

These regrets happen when you neglect the people who matter to you and who help establish your sense of wholeness. These regrets made up the largest category – humans have a massive amount of regret about fractured or unrealised relationships. These regrets sound like, “If only I had reached out.” These regrets can either be “open door” – you can still do something about it; or “closed door” – the circumstances are impossible to change.

What often thwarts repair attempts is your own flawed thinking - you massively overestimate how awkward or bothered the receiver will feel while also underestimating how positively they are likely to react.

The lesson: If it’s a closed door regret, do better next time. If it’s an open door regret, do something now.

# Moral Regrets

This category represents those times when you had a choice and took the low road. These regrets made up the smallest of the four categories, representing only about 10 percent of the total regrets Pink and his team collected. They found that while they are the smallest in number, they are the greatest in variety and often, the most individually painful. They leave you wondering, “If only I had done the right thing.”

**The lesson**: When in doubt, take the high road.
