# Living a Good Life

{{< hint warning >}}
	This is a draft and a work in progress
{{< /hint >}}

The definition of a good life varies from person to person.
It could be ambition, living peacefully or happiness. It could also be serving others.
This article summarises what i think of as a good life. It also contains my thoughts that help me
I might split this article into multiple articles in the future.

## How to Measure Life

We optimise for profitability. We try to squeeze in more work in every extra half hour we get. Our careers provide the most tangible achievements.

### Choosing the Right Yardstick is Important

In [How to measure Life](Living/How-to-measure-Life.md) , Christenson argues that a life could measure better than the position in the org hierarchy or status. We are placed in situations throughout our life.

1. Have we done well and will the people in the situations remember us fondly
2. Have i used the skills bestowed upon me improving the lives of people i care about from an anime i like. [A Good Ending](Bytes/Links-Repository.md#Good%20Death%20).

### Choosing a Kinder Version of Measurement

If were to imagine a successful person, we conjure a picture in our brain. Today we are made to believe, one can [achieve anything](Success/Kinder-Version-of-Success.md#Achievement%20and%20Expectation%20). Our [notions of success](Success/Kinder-Version-of-Success.md#Our%20notions%20of%20success%20) are
influenced by the society. It is okay to not become a wildly successful or reach the top of the social hierarchy. It is worth pursuing these goals.
We can be kind on ourselves on not being that idealistic person. After all humans are fallible.

## Search for Meaning

Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.

### Self-renewal

We will all hit points in our life where would want to do something differently. We also look back at our decisions and mull over if we did everything correctly.
We might have to renew our life on hitting such a period in our lives

## Health & Wellness

Good health is the precursor to all achievements. Take health seriously.

1. Sleep is non negotiable.
2. Maintain temperance

## Planning

### Time

[Fading out - Sylvia Plath](Bytes/Fading-out-Sylvia-Plath.md)

### Education

It is what you learn after you know it all that counts.

### Calibration

Calibrate your life

### Reducing Regrets

You regret the things you donâ€™t do, not the things you do

## Finding Peace and Alleviating Anxiety

### Interpreting Events Compassionately

People are speaking loudly in the line, skipping lines, driving rashly, honking unnecessarily. Be generously graceful towards them.
Maybe they had a fight with their spouse or having a day. Maybe a mom is late in picking up her toddler.
Choose an interpretation that makes an event less frustrating.

A friend was recently late to a meeting and blamed it on the traffic. Traffic is nothing new in the city i live. But she is a good friend, and it is better to not ruining an evening over her being late.

We should rightly remember that, the world does revolved around us. Everyone is fighting their own battles.

### Enduring Difficult times

We are what we are because of what we endure and not only because of our joys.
Seeing adversity as a gift changes our mindset and empowers us in tackling our problems with ease.
Think of the reason, a pain has entered our life. What is the purpose.

Craft a story around the pain. It builds identity.
We cannot endure a pointless torment but we can endure great pain if it's purposeful.

While it is true that not all pains can be purposeful like the death of a loved one.
[Acceptance](Mental-Wellness/Acceptance.md) helps with this.

## Eliminating Hurry & Impatience

Get rid of [Hurry sickness](Living/Giving-Up-Hurry.md#Hurry%20Sickness). We are not short of time. Definitely not short of the time it takes to be peaceful at a traffic junction. There is no reason to be flustered waiting at a line.

Being patient with achieving results. Getting off a diet because we did not lose 5 kgs in the initial week of the diet and reevaluating a solution constantly is futile.

Delegate. Delegation is not cheap but it affords you the most expensive thing in the world: time. Not just any kind of time, but time to reflect and to think, a precious commodity to say the least. We need this space to learn, space to plan.
