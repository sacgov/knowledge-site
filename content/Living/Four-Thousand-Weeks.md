# Four-thousand-weeks

My understanding of the book [Four-Thousand-Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](%20https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54785515%20)

Assuming you live to be eighty, you’ll have had about Four-Thousand-Weeks.

Humans over estimate the time we have on our hands On almost any meaningful timescale, as the contemporary philosopher Thomas Nagel has written, we will all be dead any minute

## What is Hustle?

Life on a conveyor belt

In one sense, of course, nobody these days needs telling that there isn’t enough time. We’re obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening to-do lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both
This is rebranded to hustle today

Time runs faster as we get older or so we at-least feel we try to live fully optimised lives like the _4 hour workweek_ and _smarter faster better_ books looking for life hacks
Even those of us who were bookworms as children now struggle to make it through a paragraph without experiencing the urge to reach for our phones.

## Setting Limits

Work is infinite and there is always enough work that can fill any amount of time we can free up. We should start by admitting defeat that time cannot be tamed.
The problem is not limited time but the unlimited things we want to do. Or what the society says we could do. Think of the time before time tables

Time before time tables

Deep time is when we do not realise that it is a resource that fades away. Time is only tangible when we ask questions like what did i accomplish in the last 1 month or year. Medieval farmers did the same thing harvesting, milking and parenting day in and day out. There is no point in working hard today and milking a month's milk. So they were task oriented and not time oriented. So they are never busy as there was nothing to be gained by the way of hurry

Now time is measured in its usefulness for a future goal so we will relax later. We are raised this way. But that time would never come at-least in the world of endless possibilities today. Some are passionate about bodybuilding, poetry and then there is me a productivity passionate person except a infinitely sadder life

## Emotions towards Work

Personally i derive too much meaning from work. Work makes feel accomplished for the day.
It moves me from the other wise stressful questions like the following

1. Do i want some major changes to my life?
2. Does hustling give me some assurance that i will not be regretting something later because i had anyways worked very hard

It is always tough to acknowledge that time is limited and tough decisions are inevitable

We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life, wrote Nietzsche, because to us it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think

## Fear of Missing out

FOMO is fear of missing out on something. We must realise not just missing something it is inevitable that we miss out on practically everything. Every other life and experiences that the mankind has lived though. We miss all of that. Any decision means that we are saying no to something else. That is what gives our choices meaning Be Busy but not overwhelmed Taking up more tasks than we can do is foolish. Maybe we have to let the current job go to spend more time with kids. There might not be any other way

Every time you reply to an email, there’s a good chance of provoking a reply to that email, which itself may require another reply, and so on and so on, until the heat death of the universe.

_Keep your options open_ is just another way to procrastinate tougher decisions. Far from getting things done, you’ll be creating new things to do

## Bottomless Bucket Lists

Once you stop investing in the idea that you might one day achieve peace of mind that way, it becomes easier to find peace of mind in the present, in the midst of overwhelming demands, because you’re no longer making your peace of mind dependent on dealing with all the demands. Once you stop believing that it might somehow be possible to avoid hard choices about time, it gets easier to make better ones

Think of it as existential overwhelm: the modern world provides an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and so there arises an inevitable and unbridgeable gap between what you’d ideally like to do and what you actually can do. People how enjoy are also not in control of the time. Hedonists who party each weekend think in the lines of `if only there were more weekends` or why did the weekend end. The workaholic feels only if he had more hours in the weekdays he would not have had to work on the weekend

You have too much to do, so you try to fit more in, but the ironic result is that you end up with more to do. The worst aspect of the trap, though, is that it’s also a matter of quality. The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you’ll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things. Despite my thinking of myself as the kind of person who got things done, it grew painfully clear that the things I got done most diligently were the unimportant ones, while the important ones got postponed—either forever or until an imminent deadline forced me to complete them, to a mediocre standard and in a stressful rush

## Convenience Culture

Convenience culture seduces us into imagining that we might find room for everything important by eliminating only life’s tedious tasks. But it’s a lie. You have to choose a few things, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable sense of loss that results.

We put off important task for a period of focus when all the shorter tasks tugging at us are complete. But we realise there are always more tasks to be done and we never get to the important tasks. One can waste years like this. I wasted 3 years like this from 2018 to 2021. Not 2022. What we need is an anti skill. To be okay with tasks waiting to be done. Let the place be untidy and emails and whatsapp unread. We live our life like there is all the time in the world to get to them later

Once you truly understand that you’re guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer, the fact that there are so many you still haven’t experienced stops feeling like a problem. Instead, you get to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you actually do have time for—and the freer you are to choose, in each moment, what counts the most.

## Facing Finitude of time

Rather than taking ownership of our lives, we seek out distractions, or lose ourselves in busyness and the daily grind, so as to try to forget our real predicament. Or we try to avoid the intimidating responsibility of having to decide what to do with our finite time by telling ourselves that we don’t get to choose at all—that we must get married, or remain in a soul-destroying job, or anything else, simply because it’s the done thing. Or, as we saw in the previous chapter, we embark on the futile attempt to get everything done, which is really another way of trying to evade the responsibility of deciding what to do with your finite time—because if you actually could get everything done, you’d never have to choose among mutually exclusive possibilities. Life is usually more comfortable when you spend it avoiding the truth in this fashion. But it’s a stultifying, deadly sort of comfort. It’s only by facing our finitude that we can step into a truly authentic relationship with life.

Why treat Four-Thousand-Weeks as a very small number, because it’s so tiny compared with infinity, rather than treating it as a huge number, because it’s so many more weeks than if you had never been born? The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.

## Becoming a Better Procrastinator

Pay yourself first. Start with things we want to do in the morning not by fitting it among the other smaller todos but by doing only that. If time allows do other smaller tasks limit your work in progress. Maybe to a max of 3 items. Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you’re keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts—because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead. You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important.

Allure of middling priorities List 10 important things and ignore the other 7. Not just ignore but actively avoid them. They’re the ambitions insufficiently important to him to form the core of his life yet seductive enough to distract him from the ones that matter most.

But the crucial point isn’t that it’s wrong to choose to spend your time relaxing, whether at the beach or on BuzzFeed. It’s that the distracted person isn’t really choosing at all. Their attention has been commandeered by forces that don’t have their highest interests at heart.

## Settling

You should definitely settle. Or to be more precise, you don’t have a choice. You will settle—and this fact ought to please you. The American political theorist Robert Goodin wrote a whole treatise on this topic, On Settling, in which he demonstrates, to start with, that we’re inconsistent when it comes to what we define as settling. Everyone seems to agree that if you embark on a relationship when you secretly suspect you could find someone better, you’re guilty of settling, because you’re opting to use up a portion of your life with a less-than-ideal partner. But since time is finite, the decision to refuse to settle—to spend a decade restlessly scouring online dating networks for the perfect person—is also a case of settling, because you’re opting to use up a decade of your limited time in a different sort of less-than-ideal situation. Moreover, Goodin observes, we tend to contrast a life of settling with a life of what he labels striving, or living life to the fullest. But this is a mistake, too, and not just because settling is unavoidable but also because living life to the fullest requires settling

And not only should you settle; ideally, you should settle in a way that makes it harder to back out, such as moving in together, or getting married, or having a child. The great irony of all our efforts to avoid facing finitude—to carry on believing that it might be possible not to have to choose between mutually exclusive options—is that when people finally do choose, in a relatively irreversible way, they’re usually much happier as a result. We’ll do almost anything to avoid burning our bridges, to keep alive the fantasy of a future unconstrained by limitation, yet having burned them, we’re generally pleased that we did so.

## Focus and Attention

How deep the distraction goes, and how radically it undermines our efforts to spend our finite time as we’d like. As you surface from an hour inadvertently frittered away on Facebook, you’d be forgiven for assuming that the damage, in terms of wasted time, was limited to that single misspent hour. But you’d be wrong. Because the attention economy is designed to prioritize whatever’s most compelling—instead of whatever’s most true, or most useful—it systematically distorts the picture of the world we carry in our heads at all times. It influences our sense of what matters, what kinds of threats we face, how venal our political opponents are, and thousands of other things—and all these distorted judgments then influence how we allocate our offline time as well my newborn son would do something adorable, and I’d catch myself speculating about how I might describe it in a tweet, as if what mattered wasn’t the experience but my (unpaid!) role as a provider of content for Twitter

Your finite time has been appropriated, without your realising anything’s amiss.

## Why is Boredom Unpleasant

You’ll have had to allow yourself to risk feeling claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless, and constrained by reality. This is why boredom can feel so surprisingly, aggressively unpleasant: we tend to think of it merely as a matter of not being particularly interested in whatever it is we’re doing, but in fact it’s an intense reaction to the deeply uncomfortable experience of confronting your limited control. Boredom can strike in widely differing contexts—when you’re working on a major project; when you can’t think of anything to do on a Sunday afternoon; when it’s your job to care for a two-year-old for five hours straight—but they all have one characteristic in common: they demand that you face your finitude.

Whenever we succumb to distraction, we’re attempting to flee a painful encounter with our finitude

This also makes it easier to see why the strategies generally recommended for defeating distraction—digital detoxes, personal rules about when you’ll allow yourself to check your inbox, and so forth—rarely work, or at least not for long. They involve limiting your access to the things you use to assuage your urge toward distraction, and in the case of the most addictive forms of technology, that’s surely a sensible idea. But they don’t address the urge itself. Even if you quit Facebook, or ban yourself from social media during the workday, or exile yourself to a cabin in the mountains, you’ll probably still find it unpleasantly constraining to focus on what matters, so you’ll find some way to relieve the pain by distracting yourself: by daydreaming, taking an unnecessary nap, or—the preferred option of the productivity geek—redesigning your to-do list and re organizing your desk.

The less attention we devote to objecting to what was happening to us, the more attention we could give to what is actually happening

The cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter is famous, among other reasons, for coining Hofstadter’s law, which states that any task you’re planning to tackle will always take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law

It suggests something very strange: that the activities we try to plan for somehow actively resist our efforts to make them conform to our plans. It’s as if our efforts to be good planners don’t merely fail but cause things to take longer still. Reality seems to fight back, an angry god determined to remind us that it retains the upper hand, no matter how much we try to supplicate to it by building extra slack into our schedule

## Planning and Its Struggles

The struggle for certainty is an intrinsically hopeless one—which means you have permission to stop engaging in it My point, to be clear, isn’t that it’s a bad idea to make plans, or save money for retirement, or remember to vote, so as to increase the chances that the future will turn out the way you’d like. Our efforts to influence the future aren’t the problem. The problem—the source of all the anxiety—is the need that we feel, from our vantage point here in the present moment, to be able to know that those efforts will prove successful.

But all a plan is—all it could ever possibly be—is a present-moment statement of intent. It’s an expression of your current thoughts about how you’d ideally like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of course, is under no obligation to comply.

## You Are here

In his book Back to Sanity, the psychologist Steve Taylor recalls watching tourists at the British Museum in London who weren’t really looking at the Rosetta Stone, the ancient Egyptian Artifact on display in front of them, so much as preparing to look at it later, by recording images and videos of it on their phones. So intently were they focused on using their time for a future benefit—for the ability to revisit or share the experience later on—that they were barely experiencing the exhibition itself at all.

We treat everything we’re doing—life itself, in other words—as valuable only insofar as it lays the groundwork for something else. When an activity can’t be added to the running tally of billable hours, it begins to feel like an indulgence one can’t afford. There may be more of this ethos in most of us—even the non lawyers—than we’d care to admit.

## The Purposive Man

The ‘purposive’ man, Keynes wrote, is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his actions by pushing his interests in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat’s kittens; nor in truth the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on forward forever to the end of cat-dom. For him, jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam tomorrow and never jam today. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality. Because he never has to cash out the meaningfulness of his actions in the here and now, the purposive man gets to imagine himself an omnipotent god, whose influence over reality extends infinitely off into the future; he gets to feel as though he’s truly the master of his time. But the price he pays is a steep one. He never gets to love an actual cat, in the present moment. Nor does he ever get to enjoy any actual jam. By trying too hard to make the most of his time, he misses his life

You’re so fixated on trying to make the best use of your time—in this case not for some later outcome, but for an enriching experience of life right now—that it obscures the experience itself.

## Decline of Pleasure

We are all of us compelled, Kerr wrote, to read for profit, party for contacts…gamble for charity, go out in the evening for the greater glory of the municipality, and stay home for the weekend to rebuild the house. Defenders of modern capitalism enjoy pointing out that despite how things might feel, we actually have more leisure time than we did in previous decades—an average of about five hours per day for men, and only slightly less for women. Perhaps one reason we don’t experience life that way is that leisure no longer feels very leisurely. It too often feels like another item on the to-do list.

Enjoying leisure for its own sake—which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure—comes to feel as though it’s somehow not quite enough

### Greek ’s Thoughts on Leisure

To the philosophers of the ancient world, leisure wasn’t the means to some other end; on the contrary, it was the end to which everything else worth doing was a means. Aristotle argued that true leisure—by which he meant self-reflection and philosophical contemplation—was among the very highest of virtues because it was worth choosing for its own sake, whereas other virtues, like courage in war, or noble behaviour in government, were virtuous only because they led to something else. The Latin word for business, negotium, translates literally as not-leisure, reflecting the view that work was a deviation from the highest human calling. In this understanding of the situation, work might be an unavoidable necessity for certain people—above all, for the slaves whose toil made possible the leisure of the citizens of Athens and Rome—but it was fundamentally undignified, and certainly not the main point of being alive. Work, now, demanded to be seen as the real point of existence; leisure was merely an opportunity for recovery and replenishment, for the purposes of further work. The problem was that for the average mill or factory worker, industrial work wasn’t sufficiently meaningful to be the point of existence

### Pathological Productivity

Increasingly, we’re also the kind of people who don’t actually want to rest—who find it seriously unpleasant to pause in our efforts to get things done, and who get antsy when we feel as though we’re not being sufficiently productive. Perhaps we shouldn’t be too surprised when the activities with which we fill our leisure hours increasingly come to resemble not merely work but sometimes, as in the case of a SoulCycle class or a CrossFit workout, actual physical punishment—the self-flagellation of guilty sinners anxious to expunge the stain of laziness before it’s too late.

Where’s the logic in constantly postponing fulfilment until some later point in time when soon enough you won’t have any later left?

### Hobby

The derision we heap upon the avid stamp collector or train spotter might really be a kind of defense mechanism, to spare us from confronting the possibility that they’re truly happy in a way that the rest of us—pursuing our telic lives, ceaselessly in search of future fulfillment—are not. This also helps explain why it’s far less embarrassing (indeed, positively fashionable) to have a side hustle, a hobbylike activity explicitly pursued with profit in mind.

A good hobby probably should feel a little embarrassing; that’s a sign you’re doing it for its own sake, rather than for some socially sanctioned outcome.

### Results

Results aren’t everything. Indeed, they’d better not be, because results always come later—and later is always too late.

### Impatience with Finitude of time

The pointless honk is thus symptomatic of another important way in which we’re unwilling to acknowledge our limitations when it comes to our time: it’s a howl of rage at the fact that the honker can’t prod the world around him into moving as fast as he’d like it to. [Eliminate Hurry](Living/Living-a-good-life.md#Eliminating%20Hurry%20&%20Impatience%20).

Virtually every new technology, from the steam engine to mobile broadband, has permitted us to get things done more quickly than before. Shouldn’t this therefore have reduced our impatience, by allowing us to live at something closer to the speed we’d prefer? Yet since the beginning of the modern era of acceleration, people have been responding not with satisfaction at all the time saved but with increasing agitation that they can’t make things move faster still

Once you can heat your dinner in the microwave in sixty seconds, it begins to seem genuinely realistic that you might be able to do so instantaneously, in zero seconds—and thus all the more maddeningly frustrating that you still have to wait an entire minute instead.

We’re unwilling to accept the truth that reading is the sort of activity that largely operates according to its own schedule. You can’t hurry it very much before the experience begins to lose its meaning; it refuses to consent, you might say, to our desire to exert control over how our time unfolds

## Patience - a Superpower

You give up demanding instant resolution, instant relief from discomfort and pain, and magical fixes. You breathe a sigh of relief, and as you dive into life as it really is, in clear-eyed awareness of your limitations, you begin to acquire what has become the least fashionable but perhaps most consequential of superpowers: patience.

3 rules of patience

1. Develop a taste for having problems. Behind our urge to race through every obstacle or challenge, in an effort to get it dealt with, there’s usually the unspoken fantasy that you might one day finally reach the state of having no problems whatsoever. As a result, most of us treat the problems we encounter as doubly problematic: first because of whatever specific problem we’re facing; and second because we seem to believe, if only subconsciously, that we shouldn’t have problems at all.
2. Embrace radical incrementalism. The psychology professor Robert Boice spent his career studying the writing habits of his fellow academics, reaching the conclusion that the most productive and successful among them generally made writing a smaller part of their daily routine than the others, so that it was much more feasible to keep going with it day after day. They cultivated the patience to tolerate the fact that they probably wouldn’t be producing very much on any individual day, with the result that they produced much more over the long term.
3. Setting Time Boundaries: If you’ve decided to work on a given project for fifty minutes, then once fifty minutes have elapsed, get up and walk away from it. Why? Because as Boice explained, the urge to push onward beyond that point includes a big component of impatience about not being finished, about not being productive enough, about never again finding such an ideal time for work. Stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again and again, and thus to sustain your productivity over an entire career.

## Alone Experiences

Alone experiences do not matter much in reality

Last year, I visited 17 countries; this year, I will visit 10, the author Mark Manson wrote, back when he was still a nomad himself. Last year, I saw the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China and Machu Picchu in the span of three months…But I did all this alone. A fellow wanderer, Manson learned, burst into tears in a small suburb in Japan watching families ride their bikes together in a park

Communal time is greater than personal time by over an order of magnitude

There’s the profound sense of meaning that comes from being willing to fall in with the rhythms of the rest of the word: to be free to engage in all the worthwhile collaborative endeavours that require at least some sacrifice of your sole control over what you do and when. And yet the trouble with this kind of individualist freedom, as Judith Shulevitz points out, is that a society in thrall to it, as ours is, ends up desynchronising itself—imposing upon itself something surprisingly similar, in its results, to the disastrous Soviet experiment with a staggered five-day week. We live less and less of our lives in the same temporal grooves as one another. The unbridled reign of this individualist ethos, fuelled by the demands of the market economy, has overwhelmed our traditional ways of organising time, meaning that the hours in which we rest, work, and socialize are becoming ever more uncoordinated. It’s harder than ever to find time for a leisurely family dinner, a spontaneous visit to friends, or any collective project—nurturing a community garden, playing in an amateur rock band—that takes place in a setting other than the workplace.

## Dent in the Universe

There have only been a few dozen such people in the entire history of humanity. In other words, you almost certainly won’t put a dent in the universe. Indeed, depending on the stringency of your criteria, even Steve Jobs, who coined that phrase, failed to leave such a dent. Perhaps the iPhone will be remembered for more generations than anything you or I will ever accomplish; but from a truly cosmic view, it will soon be forgotten, like everything else.

## Final Words and Questions to Ourselves

No wonder it comes as a relief to be reminded of your insignificance: it’s the feeling of realising that you’d been holding yourself, all this time, to standards you couldn’t reasonably be expected to meet. And this realisation isn’t merely calming but liberating, because once you’re no longer burdened by such an unrealistic definition of a life well spent

1. Where in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what’s called for is a little discomfort? Does this choice diminish me, or enlarge me?
2. Are you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet
3. In what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?

A closely related way to postpone the confrontation with finitude — with the anxiety-inducing truth that this is it—is to treat your present-day life as part of a journey toward becoming the kind of person you believe believe you ought to become

In which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you’re doing? How would you spend your days differently if you didn’t care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?

## What is a Man's Best Path ?

The best path is to quietly do the next and most necessary thing. So long as you think you don’t yet know what that is, you still have too much time/money to spend in useless speculation. But if you do with conviction the next and most necessary thing, you are always doing something meaningful and intended by fate. A modified version of this insight, Do the next right thing, has since become a slogan favoured among members of Alcoholics Anonymous, as a way to proceed sanely through moments of acute crisis. But really, the next and most necessary thing is all that any of us can ever aspire to do in any moment. And we must do it despite not having any objective way to be sure what the right course of action even is. Fortunately, precisely because that’s all you can do, it’s also all that you ever have to do. If you can face the truth about time in this way—if you can step more fully into the condition of being a limited human—you will reach the greatest heights of productivity, accomplishment, service, and fulfilment that were ever in the world The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short. But that isn’t a reason for unremitting despair, or for living in an anxiety fueled panic about making the most of your limited time. It’s a cause for relief. You get to give up on something that was always impossible—the quest to become the optimised, infinitely capable, emotionally invincible, fully independent person you’re officially supposed to be. Then you get to roll up your sleeves and start work on what’s gloriously possible instead.
