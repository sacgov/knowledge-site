# Sleeping well

Notes from Huberman's [sleep toolkit](https://hubermanlab.com/toolkit-for-sleep/)

So here is my list for how to get better at sleeping:

1. View sunlight by going outside within 30-60 minutes of waking. Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. If you wake up before the sun is out and you want to be awake, turn on artificial lights and then go outside once the sun rises. On bright cloudless days: view morning and afternoon sun for 10 min; cloudy days: 20 min; very overcast days 30-60 min. If you live someplace with very minimal light, consider an artificial daytime simulator source.
   Don’t wear sunglasses for this practice if you safely can, but contact lenses and eyeglasses are fine. No, you don’t have to look directly at the sun, and never look at ANY light so bright it is painful to view! That said, you can’t wear a brimmed hat, sunglasses and remain in the shade and expect to “wake up” your circadian clock.
2. Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy. Pushing through the sleepy late evening feeling and going to sleep too late (for you) is one reason people wake at 3 am and can’t fall back asleep.
3. Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. Dr. Matt Walker (sleep expert from UC Berkeley) might even say 12-14 hours. I do fine with caffeine at 2 pm and I go to sleep at ~10-11 pm. Caffeine is anti adenosine (the neuro trasmitter that promotes sleep)
4. Avoid viewing bright lights—especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. Here is a simple rule: only use as much artificial lighting as is necessary for you to remain and move about safely at night. Blue blockers can help a bit at night but still dim the lights. Viewing bright lights of all colors are a problem for your circadian system. Candlelight and moonlight are fine.
5. Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don’t nap at all. I love naps as do many of my colleagues. I tend to nap for 30 min most afternoons… maybe 45 min, but never longer.
6. Expect to feel really alert ~1 hour before your natural bedtime. This is a naturally occurring spike in wakefulness that sleep researchers have observed.
7. Keep the room you sleep in cool and dark and layer on blankets that you can remove. Your body needs to drop in temperature by 1-3 degrees to fall and stay asleep effectively. Body temperature increases are one reason you wake up. Thus, keep your room cool and remove blankets as needed. If it’s too hot you would have to use a cooling device and that’s harder than simply tossing off blankets if you get too warm.
8. Drinking alcohol messes up your sleep. As do most sleep medications.
9. We might be night owls at 15 but become “morning people” as we age or need 6 hours a night in summer and 7-8 in winter. It will vary.

## Critical Periods

Get suns in these times

1. Early morning
2. Later afternoon
3. Late evening

Late evening sunset wavelength signals sleep is coming soon
Avoid super markets like the plague before sleeping. They are too bright.
Use candle lights or lights on the floor instead of overhead lights.

Exercise raises body temperature and makes it difficult to sleep.
Sleep requires lower body temperature.
It is best to set the room temperature to 3 degree lesser with Fans or AC.

## Tips

1. **Naps** - better not to have and if we do have - make them less than 90 mins
2. Hot bath for a small duration cools the body and helps us sleep
3. Use apps to sleep better.
4. Breathe through the nose and not the mouth
5. Alcohol causes sleep to erratic though we fall asleep quickly
6. Never change the sleeping and waking times by more than an hour
7. It is better to wake up at the same time and nap in the afternoon if we feel like it
8. We have temperature minimum at 2-3 hours before the sleep
9. If we wake up at this time and do an exercise we can become early riser
10. If we wake up 2 hours before the temperature minimum we can push the sleep cycle to later
